    "    {\"title\": \"Talk 1-1\", \"content\": \"No, absolutely. Doc Chapman, Dr Coolidge, everybody else who's currently on this call, thanks for the opportunity to really talk about what is extremely important and fundamental in our space, and it's the concept of shared decision making in what we do in chronic pain and management, but really going into the ethical and public health implications that we face pretty much every day, you can argue. And my hope is that, you know, I'll be able to really define what what shared decision making in pain management actually means, going to some of the bioethical principles of shared decision making in a space, and then hopefully analyze the ethical and public health implications of of shared decision making in a chronic pain space. Now the agenda is going to be as it's going to be pretty straightforward. I'll go through the introduction, go through the pain management aspect, the bioethical principles, public health and really my punchline that I usually call when in doubt. So I think there's a fundamental understanding of how history has panned out when it comes to medical decision making. And what's very interesting is, if you look back to the 1900s all the way down to early 1990s you can see that there's there was a huge gap in really understanding the psychology of that patient physician relationship. But what is obvious is that the trend is migrating towards and empowering patients to ensure that they understand why they, why they they receive the care that they did, that they do. Now, having said that is what exactly are we referring to shared as shared decision making. This idea is that the patient and the physician develops shared goals. They develop informed decision and there is patient engagement where the patient is actively involved in the decision making process about their health and the care that they receive. Now this is important, and the reason why this is important is because when shared decision making is implemented, studies have shown that it promotes patient autonomy, satisfaction and the value and preferences of the patients are recognized early to. In the journey of their care. Not shocking. You can see that there are numerous studies, numerous studies that actually talk about the role of shared decision making as it pertains to patient satisfaction, treatment adherence, reducing inequalities, cost reduction and even improving or minimizing what what has been referred to as the decision conflict process that most of us have probably encountered during our clinic visit. So now, the real summary that I you know, one of the summary that I put out here is just so as an audience, you can extrapolate some of the major findings from from the literature. Is the major benefits of shared decision making is there is improved patient and provider satisfaction, which is pretty straightforward, if applied correctly, there is better enhancements to treatment adherence, healthcare outcomes, such as reduction of pain scores, reduction of blood pressure, reduction especially in The primary care space, outcomes that pertains to chronic diseases, it's been documented to see significant improvement in those in those outcomes. Not surprisingly, when there is shared participation, there is reduction in decisional conflict and and multiple studies have reported better efficiency in running that clinical practice increased cost savings, and, like I mentioned previously, reduction of health inequalities, which we're going to get into in the public health aspect. So now we're going to migrate from this broad framework of shared decision making to looking at the evidence, the definition of the pain space, some of the potential decision considerations we should think about as we really go through this framework of shared decision making in a pain space. So not surprisingly, there are multiple studies that have been put out there regarding shared decision making in the pain space. I put this as a reference for for the audience to go back to, should you, if you want to go through some of the high yield studies, clinical trials, as well as review articles out there? But one of the ones that I that I thought was very pertinent to what we do in the chronic pain space goes back to Lisa's article and Lee and Dr Key's article about really how to think about the concept of that patient provider interaction as it relates to shared decision making. Now in the pain space, it's not any different. It's not any different from what you see in the non pain space. When you think about shared decision making, our patient population could be you could classify as pretty complicated because of the multiple etiology that can explain the pain symptoms that they have from the bio psychosocial to the physiologic changes, mechanical changes, physiological changes. But it's the same concept, right? Regardless of the etiology of the chronic pain state. It's the idea that in the in a pain space, shared decision making is sharing information between provider and patients, expressing candid opinions that is geared towards the patient's clinical outcome, and finally, and more importantly, building a consensus towards a treatment decision that will enhance the patient's outcome during your visit. Now I'm going to go through a few process that that could hopefully create a concept of shared decision making and how it can be applied even further in the pain space. The study I just present that I just displayed by Charles really does a good job going through what this encounter looks like. And from this study, which is very cited in the shared decision making space, it comes down to understanding what this definition of shared means. And like I mentioned, participants include the physician and the patient. The information sharing has to be bi directional. It's not just the physician empowering the patient about their diagnosis. It has to be the physician also receiving from the patient what the true. Understand about the diagnosis, so that bi directionality is very important, and the third component is a concept of consensus, that there is an agreement and and the agreement is more because there is understanding of preferred treatment by the patient, and also an understanding of what the conveyed diagnosis is by the physician, and obviously the final component of this is agreeing to a treatment plan that is going going to be executed.\"},\n",
    "    {\"title\": \"Talk 1-2\", \"content\": \"When is this appropriate? When is shared decision making appropriate? I think this is a great slide, a great study, because what it helps us do is, you know, really think about, at what level should we be thinking about the shared decision making, what setting? And what was great about this study was they looked at multiple areas where shared decision making processes have been implemented and and what it came down to was the characteristics of the setting where you can most likely see that a very impactful component of shared decision making is settings where there is a short time frame to make a decision, a high impact decision, like going for a surgical intervention that could be life saving, or that could be, that could be, that could result to terminal outcomes if not performed, and and a Decision characteristic setting where there is this preference sensitivity components to the conversation. And it's also found that when there is uncertainty of outcomes in a setting where the clinical practice exists, it tends to yield a very impactful indication for utilizing shared decision making. Now, if you think about the chronic pain space, whether you are a surgeon or a psychologist or a psychiatrist or an interventional pain physician or a dentist who manages pain from multiple etiology, what you recognize is in a practice that is busy, or in a practice where you're encountering so much patient, these actually apply, and I do think because of some of this characteristic, it's very easy to argue the need for shared decision making in our pain space. Now what I wanted to highlight about this slide is the study actually goes through multiple specialties, and it's the idea that the the areas or the setting where you encounter a preference sensitive dialog, A preference sensitive conversation, it is not unusual to to start considering the impact of shared decision making in that encounter, and right here, you can tell the darkest you know, the darkest color just implies that the shared decision making was used more frequently and not surprising. You can see that in oncology and a lot of other settings, such as primary care and mental health. So just that data to present out there. Now, the one thing that I thought was going to be very impactful to in trying to understand this framework is, you know, really understanding what what the evidence is. Now the conceptual framework for shared decision making, you know, this really takes me back to, you know, my public health background is the idea of understanding relationships, right? So when you think about a study and you're trying to figure out the relationship between the exposures and outcomes, you know, you think about direct acyclic graphs. I mean, these are not directed cyclic graphs. But the idea is that a very interesting conceptual framework by crepes, postulates that communication can be can impact patient outcomes and reduce symptoms, improve quality of life, improve physiological measures if you actually create direct engagement between parties and and that's almost like a no brainer, but it's an important framework to think about, because when you when you think about that busy pain practice, it's very hard to implement, because having This direct, impactful conversation without a structural framework could be, could be very tricky. Now, what gets very exciting, though, is the indirect pathway, and it's the idea that if you're actually able to create this direct path, you can indirectly start impacting the patient's secondary outcomes, or or or outcomes that you don't foresee could have been impacted. Acted like the behavioral aspect, the effective cognitive component, and that, by itself, again, creates this framework for understanding how shared decision making can be implemented in our individual practice. Now, I like this saying by a tool, Dr Gawande, and it's the idea that patients come to us, you know, not just because they need some kind of a cure, you know, they want to find meaning and understanding. What this means the most to patients is really the key to to helping them travel through this journey and and I really love this statement, because it truly creates a ground for for taking a step back every time we encounter, especially that challenging case in in our practice. Now, having said that, I'm going to dive into some of the bioethical component of of this conversation, and my hope is to go through some of the ethical consideration as it pertains to shared decision making, and also, again, go back to what a potential conceptual framework could be utilized as we think about the bioethical aspects with shared decision making in our chronic pain population. So for the purpose of this talk, and you know that the ethical part, you could dive in as deep as you can and and there's so many aspects of what we do that can be that have multiple ethical consideration. But for the purpose of this talk, I'm going to focus on these four pillars, the concept of autonomy that we're all aware of, which is respecting the patient's choice and values and decision making. Beneficence, which is promoting well being by managing the pain effectively. Non maleficence, which is avoiding interventions that may cause harm or the do no harm, phrases we were all aware of, and really justice as it comes down to ensuring equitable access to pain management and minimizing inequality. You know, these are the four pillars of the ethical consideration that I will hopefully dive into the next few for the next few slides, and then go step out so we can create a conceptual framework to further understand this better. So before going into some of those bioethical concepts, what is the real challenge here? So the real challenge, and some of you may agree, and I'm sure there's more to this, but the real challenge in a chronic pain space is like any other space, whether it's healthcare or non healthcare, patient satisfaction, or what you can refer to as customer satisfaction in a pain space, patient satisfaction, unfortunately, 79% of patients with chronic pain are dissatisfied with your care, and it's for multiple reasons. We can go into those reasons, but primarily, a lot of these dissatisfaction comes down to miscommunication or some kind of lack of understanding between parties involved, whether it's a physician and a patient, whether it's payers and a patient, whether it's even between patients and family member, there is a huge component of lack of clarity communication and dissatisfaction, and that seems to be a very, very impactful when it comes to dealing with some of the negative outcomes in our space. The other components to what creates a challenge for us on our daily basis, as a concept of using medications that could significantly be either psychoactive, addictive or again, you know, these are neuromodulatory or or or physiologically modulating drugs that can impact not just the pain state, but but other outcomes that that could be that is extremely important. And you know, we've seen this in the context of the opioid crisis that was, you know, observed in the US and now across multiple parts of the world, but, but again, this creates a challenge for us in this space. And the same thing applies to healthcare by itself. You know how sustainable it is, because you and I already know we, we all face the some of the rigors of approval for patients to even get access to the care that they deserve or or clinically justified. And again, creates another challenge for us, because here now we're looking at we're looking at that, the concept that that that when we go into our practice, these are ethical things that we need to really be very mindful of now, Now, having said that, though our ethical obligation remains the same, right so the. Central value of medicine is to ameliorate suffering in patients and chronic pain patients, cancer and non cancer pain are extremely, extremely vulnerable patients, and it's extremely important that the principles of non maleficence, beneficence, justice and and patient autonomy, respect for patient autonomy, be considered in this setting. So So now let's go through a few concepts.\"},\n",
    "    {\"title\": \"Talk 1-3\", \"content\": \"I really want to highlight this, this book, and I say this because there was in a lot of depth in content written by our own, Dr shatman, and a lot of the framework and understanding we're very, very, very detailed in in this, in this literature, in this book, and highly recommend it. So, having said that, let's talk about patient autonomy. You know, very simple understanding. Sorry, did I was there a question? Okay, so patient autonomy. Now, the concept of patient autonomy is respecting the independent wishes of the patient. Sounds straightforward. Well, not necessarily, right, because what, what the what the patient desires, may not always correlate with what the clinical outcome could be. Could could be resulted to, but it all but, but in the end, the definition is very clear. The patient has the right to refuse or accept treatment, and that's what creates the autonomy. Now, what is a challenge in our pain space, right? If you think about the patient autonomy in our space, you can you can easily tie that to patients or gradually losing control of their care, because just the disease states itself creates such an experience where, you know, there is a negative sequela that comes from just being in chronic pain state, the emotional, behavioral, social, recreational, you know, you name it, financial and also legal. Ramification, you know, it gradually chips away the patient's ability to make decision, and, and, and a lot of you who are seeing patients at multiple spaces, whether it's on the psychological part or treating headaches or back pain, neck pain, or performing surgical procedures. You can tell that a lot of these patients who are in this quantification state or or chronicity, if you want to call it, are losing autonomy every day. And it's and it's important to recognize this, because it creates a layer of challenge in this bioethical framework and not to go into the patient healthcare coverage. Now that raises a question, though, what we think is this really, is this autonomy, or are we? Are we looking into non maleficence, versus maleficence? You know, you could, you could argue multiple components of healthcare coverage, and we're going to dive into it a little bit. So non maleficence, again, the concept of do no harm, it's challenging, right? Because there is this. The concept of do no harm as a clinician is very simple. You understand the application of the therapies you're recommending to the patients, and you're minimizing every possible way of of impacting this patient negatively. However, the patient may not have access to this therapy. And the question of non maleficence, it really goes down to some of the ethical dilemma we see with payers, and I would say with healthcare administrators, right? So a patient needs a therapy, the therapy is not covered because, based on the internal laws, the internal ethos or regulatory policies created by the payers the patient may not necessarily have access to the therapy. Now, does that mean that this is maleficence? Well, the payers may not see it that way, because they they they may create a policy that they think is ethical and moral to their cooperation, and based on that policy, patients could be denied care, you know, but as a clinician, we see the opposite, right? Because we see the clinical indication, we see that there is strong evidence, there is there is clinical trials and studies that have shown that this therapy works, and from our perspective, clearly when that's when it's so clear that the evidence could support good outcome, you can, you can strongly argue that that it's at least maleficence, because maleficence suggests that you know it's wrong doing right you're not. You may not physically harm someone directly, but. It's wrong doing and over time that can, that can potentially result to harm. So again, frameworks, ethical frameworks to think about when you when we think about maleficence in our space. Now, beneficence is pretty straightforward, and it's the idea that you know, you promote well being by controlling the pain effectively and and this is the primary goal of of of that we the primary goal of chronic pain professionals as well as healthcare providers in this space. But again, we run into the same challenges, and you can when you run into a profit model enterprise where emphasis is placed on cost reduction and emphasis is placed on profitability, you really run the risk of providing adequate resources to promote patients well being, and we see similar setting in where you see similar outcomes, where beneficence is compromised because economic models are placed over therapeutic models. So again, you can kind of see the intertwined with beneficence and non maleficence. But it's the same idea that when you reduce the access to resources that patients could have utilized, you can really impact their well being. Now justice again, is that the other component I was going to really talk about, and again, it's the idea that you're ensuring equitable access to patients who are in chronic pain. You know, there's several studies that have been put out there reporting under treatment of vulnerable population, minority population, underserved population. Physicians recognize this as a concern. Historically, the amount of awareness was not as not as high, compared to moving to more recent studies, and that I consider as progress. But again, it's important to understand what can be done or or at least recognize why some of these things are present in our practice. Now, when you look at inequalities in chronic pain management, it is not surprising to see that the studies studies have reported low income education like, you know, having less education certain ethnic or minority group and race as well as gender, are significantly impacted. There's several studies reporting African Americans having having inequalities in outcome, as well as even female patients having inequalities and outcomes and when it comes to the chronic pain states, and not to forget the third party payers, who unfortunately can make decisions internally that can impact who can eventually have access to care, thereby compounding or or increasing the inequalities that we see so So, having said that, you know, I think one of the things that I want to really shift into is the framework. I'm just going to adjust my screen a little bit here in the framework. \"},\n",
    "    {\"title\": \"Talk 1-4\", \"content\": \"Now, what are the ethical framework that we should consider, consider when we think about shared decision making in our space. You've, you know, we've all seen what the pillars of bioethics in a pain space could look like. Now, what are the frameworks that we can consider to truly, truly start changing the dialog and and I truly like this article written by dinof at the British Journal of anesthesia, of anesthesia. And it's the idea of taking advantage of understanding Chaldeans framework and codigens framework is really straightforward, and it says that the purpose of of dialog, if it's centered around human flourishing, medical treatment or diagnosis, goals of care, values and benefits, and really understanding the concepts of health that one can actually aspire or, more importantly, achieve a better healthcare outcome in in a pain space and and there, you know, there's several ways to understand this. For from a medical test component, it comes down to how you interact with the patient regarding their imaging. From a human flourishing component, it goes back to how you interact with the patient, about their well being. Goals of care. It goes back to how you interact with the patient regarding what does the patient want? What what is this autonomous to them? Or am I? Am I Am I pushing this decision on the patient values and belief? Very similar concepts of health. Again, very similar. Are you communicating with the patient, whether it's through visual aids, whether it's through AI, whether it's through a structural a mental structure that ensures that the patient is a part of the care. Are you using this five components to achieve that? And and collagen framework suggests that if you can incorporate some of this five framework into your daily practice, you can most likely, or you can at least strive to achieve shared decision making process in the pains in your chronic pain space. So the other component of this, which I thought was very interesting, little bit more complicated, and I put this as a reference, so what? So we can all go back to it if you're interested, to try to try to tease out the ethical decision making process. And this was published by Anna as well as Dr shatman, a journal of pain research, looking at what the conceptual framework should be. I do think what is important to mention is you have to be able to understand what the role is as a healthcare provider and really understand the role of the patient. And the reason why that's critical is because they're interchangeable. Okay? It's almost like running statistics, right? If you understand the association between variables, you're going to be able to predict what the outcomes are. Now it's the understanding of the variable is so important. And what I like about about this presentation, about this concept, is the moral is you, one has to understand the role that they play as a healthcare provider, but more importantly, understand the role of the patient and and the happy medium is when relationship between both roles are established and communication is very clear, you can achieve a Much better, ethical conversation that can result to hopefully better healthcare outcome. So now we're going to go to the public health component of this conversation. And again, my goal would be to really highlight some of the challenges the framework, again, that we can work with, some of the processes that comes with shared decision making and and really understanding what some of the potential barriers could be with shared decision making. So again, a few papers to highlight the public health aspects of what we do in a chronic pain space. I do like the study. I like to review. I do like the review article written by Dr Steve Cohen recently on Lance, said really highlighting what the burden is for the burden of chronic pain, when the society itself, and it goes back to understanding the pathophysiology, the biopsychosocial model, really understanding how the etiology itself is not just a broken femur. You know, it's the it's the it's the social, psychological, a really good article, highly recommended and not not shocking when you talk about public health and pain, it's very difficult to ignore the opioid crisis, as that was one of the biggest public health concern that we had encountered in this space and still continue to encounter, though it's improved significantly and and then I there's another, another good article I recommend is one by males published in British Journal of anesthesia in 2019 really going through what these factors are that that could be associated with the public health related outcomes in the pain space, and I'll dive into that in the next slide and in subsequent slide. Now, the one thing I wanted to just bring up is, you know, the opioid component, because and in a chronic pain space that the opiate pandemic really shook how we thought about caring for patients and and multiple guidelines have been put in place to mitigate some of this public health concern. And the CDC continues to provide, you know, evidence based guidelines to improve communication. And this is important, because with utilizing shared decision making between you and your patient. It could, you can, one can, can. One can attain even better clinical outcome, because you get to discuss limiting initial prescription when necessary, you get to discuss use of alternative methods, such as the injections, the psychological evaluation or treatment, and then, more importantly, discuss the risk and benefits. So again, you're going into the whole concept of addressing some of the major aspect that has resulted to the pandemic, opioid pandemic in the first place. And I thought it was an important slide to communicate. Yeah. Now, when we think about chronic pain and public health, it's a very complex relationship, and I say complex because we very few studies and and I really wasn't convinced with some of the reports in the literature, partly because it's very hard to really study, but we all know it exists. And the public health component of chronic pain is a complex relationship, but it ties back to understanding the key players or variables that that is, whether directly or indirectly, associated with healthcare outcomes and in a pain space, it's not shocking to see that in in in an age group, gender, ethnic group, cultural background, socio economic background, employment status, and how all of those can has actually impacted access to care or or even ability to go back to work. And the other thing that I that I thought was worth mentioning is lifestyle and behavior and clearly the clinical outcomes some patients coming to the clinic with already more severe pain state versus others who have had access with with less severe pain states, thereby even creating a much more complex relationship. Now is that a public health crisis? Is that a public health issue? I do think a lot a lot of research still needs to be done to truly tie that relationship. What is very clear, though, is that there is a relationship between socio economic status and healthcare outcomes. There is very clear relationship between social economic outcomes and as social determinants of health. And clearly, if that relationship can result to an economic burden, one can hypothesize that you can eventually see the association with with public health and chronic pain and again, don't forget the biopsychosocial model as well. So now, having said that, the question now is, we know that there is a relationship between public health and chronic pain. Now, where does shared decision making come into play? I wanted to really go through this article because it the article did a really good job going through how shared decision making could reduce health inequalities, and it cut across all specialties, not necessarily in the pain space. And these authors, what they did was really looked at, they performed a met a systematic review and meta analysis. They utilized shared decision making models. So the study utilized shared decision making models, it was included. And what was very interesting was they looked at the population of the studies, and if the population had at least 50% that were underserved, that the studies were included in this analysis, and what was found, which I'm not going to go into details, is if you look at the forest plot of the study, was that the forest plot was favorable, favorable towards improving healthcare outcomes Among disadvantaged patients if shared decision making process was implemented. So again, these are very encouraging studies to really highlight that there is signals and there are, there's data out there suggesting that we can, we can truly utilize SDM for improving patient outcome. Now, one of the things that I just wanted to highlight in terms of thinking about what this means is, you know, again, going back to shared decision making process, you introduce a decision, the patient understands it, you present the option, you make recommendation, and then it's always important to ensure that the patient understands it. And the final goal is that a consensus is made where the clinician and patient makes a shared decision based on the clinical evidence, the patient's value and patient patient's preference. There are multiple studies that have discussed how this could be accomplished. Visual aids, AI, all have seemed to be impactful in multiple settings.\"},\n",

      "Title: Talk 1, Content: No, absolutely. Doc Chapman, Dr Coolidge, everybody else who's currently on this call, thanks for the opportunity to really talk about what is extremely important and fundamental in our space, and it's the concept of shared decision making in what we do in chronic pain and management, but really going into the ethical and public health implications that we face pretty much every day, you can argue. And my hope is that, you know, I'll be able to really define what what shared decision making in pain management actually means, going to some of the bioethical principles of shared decision making in a space, and then hopefully analyze the ethical and public health implications of of shared decision making in a chronic pain space. Now the agenda is going to be as it's going to be pretty straightforward. I'll go through the introduction, go through the pain management aspect, the bioethical principles, public health and really my punchline that I usually call when in doubt. So I think there's a fundamental understanding of how history has panned out when it comes to medical decision making. And what's very interesting is, if you look back to the 1900s all the way down to early 1990s you can see that there's there was a huge gap in really understanding the psychology of that patient physician relationship. But what is obvious is that the trend is migrating towards and empowering patients to ensure that they understand why they, why they they receive the care that they did, that they do. Now, having said that is what exactly are we referring to shared as shared decision making. This idea is that the patient and the physician develops shared goals. They develop informed decision and there is patient engagement where the patient is actively involved in the decision making process about their health and the care that they receive. Now this is important, and the reason why this is important is because when shared decision making is implemented, studies have shown that it promotes patient autonomy, satisfaction and the value and preferences of the patients are recognized early to. In the journey of their care. Not shocking. You can see that there are numerous studies, numerous studies that actually talk about the role of shared decision making as it pertains to patient satisfaction, treatment adherence, reducing inequalities, cost reduction and even improving or minimizing what what has been referred to as the decision conflict process that most of us have probably encountered during our clinic visit. So now, the real summary that I you know, one of the summary that I put out here is just so as an audience, you can extrapolate some of the major findings from from the literature. Is the major benefits of shared decision making is there is improved patient and provider satisfaction, which is pretty straightforward, if applied correctly, there is better enhancements to treatment adherence, healthcare outcomes, such as reduction of pain scores, reduction of blood pressure, reduction especially in The primary care space, outcomes that pertains to chronic diseases, it's been documented to see significant improvement in those in those outcomes. Not surprisingly, when there is shared participation, there is reduction in decisional conflict and and multiple studies have reported better efficiency in running that clinical practice increased cost savings, and, like I mentioned previously, reduction of health inequalities, which we're going to get into in the public health aspect. So now we're going to migrate from this broad framework of shared decision making to looking at the evidence, the definition of the pain space, some of the potential decision considerations we should think about as we really go through this framework of shared decision making in a pain space. So not surprisingly, there are multiple studies that have been put out there regarding shared decision making in the pain space. I put this as a reference for for the audience to go back to, should you, if you want to go through some of the high yield studies, clinical trials, as well as review articles out there? But one of the ones that I that I thought was very pertinent to what we do in the chronic pain space goes back to Lisa's article and Lee and Dr Key's article about really how to think about the concept of that patient provider interaction as it relates to shared decision making. Now in the pain space, it's not any different. It's not any different from what you see in the non pain space. When you think about shared decision making, our patient population could be you could classify as pretty complicated because of the multiple etiology that can explain the pain symptoms that they have from the bio psychosocial to the physiologic changes, mechanical changes, physiological changes. But it's the same concept, right? Regardless of the etiology of the chronic pain state. It's the idea that in the in a pain space, shared decision making is sharing information between provider and patients, expressing candid opinions that is geared towards the patient's clinical outcome, and finally, and more importantly, building a consensus towards a treatment decision that will enhance the patient's outcome during your visit. Now I'm going to go through a few process that that could hopefully create a concept of shared decision making and how it can be applied even further in the pain space. The study I just present that I just displayed by Charles really does a good job going through what this encounter looks like. And from this study, which is very cited in the shared decision making space, it comes down to understanding what this definition of shared means. And like I mentioned, participants include the physician and the patient. The information sharing has to be bi directional. It's not just the physician empowering the patient about their diagnosis. It has to be the physician also receiving from the patient what the true. Understand about the diagnosis, so that bi directionality is very important, and the third component is a concept of consensus, that there is an agreement and and the agreement is more because there is understanding of preferred treatment by the patient, and also an understanding of what the conveyed diagnosis is by the physician, and obviously the final component of this is agreeing to a treatment plan that is going going to be executed., Embedding Dimensions: 768\n",
      "Title: Talk 2, Content: When is this appropriate? When is shared decision making appropriate? I think this is a great slide, a great study, because what it helps us do is, you know, really think about, at what level should we be thinking about the shared decision making, what setting? And what was great about this study was they looked at multiple areas where shared decision making processes have been implemented and and what it came down to was the characteristics of the setting where you can most likely see that a very impactful component of shared decision making is settings where there is a short time frame to make a decision, a high impact decision, like going for a surgical intervention that could be life saving, or that could be, that could be, that could result to terminal outcomes if not performed, and and a Decision characteristic setting where there is this preference sensitivity components to the conversation. And it's also found that when there is uncertainty of outcomes in a setting where the clinical practice exists, it tends to yield a very impactful indication for utilizing shared decision making. Now, if you think about the chronic pain space, whether you are a surgeon or a psychologist or a psychiatrist or an interventional pain physician or a dentist who manages pain from multiple etiology, what you recognize is in a practice that is busy, or in a practice where you're encountering so much patient, these actually apply, and I do think because of some of this characteristic, it's very easy to argue the need for shared decision making in our pain space. Now what I wanted to highlight about this slide is the study actually goes through multiple specialties, and it's the idea that the the areas or the setting where you encounter a preference sensitive dialog, A preference sensitive conversation, it is not unusual to to start considering the impact of shared decision making in that encounter, and right here, you can tell the darkest you know, the darkest color just implies that the shared decision making was used more frequently and not surprising. You can see that in oncology and a lot of other settings, such as primary care and mental health. So just that data to present out there. Now, the one thing that I thought was going to be very impactful to in trying to understand this framework is, you know, really understanding what what the evidence is. Now the conceptual framework for shared decision making, you know, this really takes me back to, you know, my public health background is the idea of understanding relationships, right? So when you think about a study and you're trying to figure out the relationship between the exposures and outcomes, you know, you think about direct acyclic graphs. I mean, these are not directed cyclic graphs. But the idea is that a very interesting conceptual framework by crepes, postulates that communication can be can impact patient outcomes and reduce symptoms, improve quality of life, improve physiological measures if you actually create direct engagement between parties and and that's almost like a no brainer, but it's an important framework to think about, because when you when you think about that busy pain practice, it's very hard to implement, because having This direct, impactful conversation without a structural framework could be, could be very tricky. Now, what gets very exciting, though, is the indirect pathway, and it's the idea that if you're actually able to create this direct path, you can indirectly start impacting the patient's secondary outcomes, or or or outcomes that you don't foresee could have been impacted. Acted like the behavioral aspect, the effective cognitive component, and that, by itself, again, creates this framework for understanding how shared decision making can be implemented in our individual practice. Now, I like this saying by a tool, Dr Gawande, and it's the idea that patients come to us, you know, not just because they need some kind of a cure, you know, they want to find meaning and understanding. What this means the most to patients is really the key to to helping them travel through this journey and and I really love this statement, because it truly creates a ground for for taking a step back every time we encounter, especially that challenging case in in our practice. Now, having said that, I'm going to dive into some of the bioethical component of of this conversation, and my hope is to go through some of the ethical consideration as it pertains to shared decision making, and also, again, go back to what a potential conceptual framework could be utilized as we think about the bioethical aspects with shared decision making in our chronic pain population. So for the purpose of this talk, and you know that the ethical part, you could dive in as deep as you can and and there's so many aspects of what we do that can be that have multiple ethical consideration. But for the purpose of this talk, I'm going to focus on these four pillars, the concept of autonomy that we're all aware of, which is respecting the patient's choice and values and decision making. Beneficence, which is promoting well being by managing the pain effectively. Non maleficence, which is avoiding interventions that may cause harm or the do no harm, phrases we were all aware of, and really justice as it comes down to ensuring equitable access to pain management and minimizing inequality. You know, these are the four pillars of the ethical consideration that I will hopefully dive into the next few for the next few slides, and then go step out so we can create a conceptual framework to further understand this better. So before going into some of those bioethical concepts, what is the real challenge here? So the real challenge, and some of you may agree, and I'm sure there's more to this, but the real challenge in a chronic pain space is like any other space, whether it's healthcare or non healthcare, patient satisfaction, or what you can refer to as customer satisfaction in a pain space, patient satisfaction, unfortunately, 79% of patients with chronic pain are dissatisfied with your care, and it's for multiple reasons. We can go into those reasons, but primarily, a lot of these dissatisfaction comes down to miscommunication or some kind of lack of understanding between parties involved, whether it's a physician and a patient, whether it's payers and a patient, whether it's even between patients and family member, there is a huge component of lack of clarity communication and dissatisfaction, and that seems to be a very, very impactful when it comes to dealing with some of the negative outcomes in our space. The other components to what creates a challenge for us on our daily basis, as a concept of using medications that could significantly be either psychoactive, addictive or again, you know, these are neuromodulatory or or or physiologically modulating drugs that can impact not just the pain state, but but other outcomes that that could be that is extremely important. And you know, we've seen this in the context of the opioid crisis that was, you know, observed in the US and now across multiple parts of the world, but, but again, this creates a challenge for us in this space. And the same thing applies to healthcare by itself. You know how sustainable it is, because you and I already know we, we all face the some of the rigors of approval for patients to even get access to the care that they deserve or or clinically justified. And again, creates another challenge for us, because here now we're looking at we're looking at that, the concept that that that when we go into our practice, these are ethical things that we need to really be very mindful of now, Now, having said that, though our ethical obligation remains the same, right so the. Central value of medicine is to ameliorate suffering in patients and chronic pain patients, cancer and non cancer pain are extremely, extremely vulnerable patients, and it's extremely important that the principles of non maleficence, beneficence, justice and and patient autonomy, respect for patient autonomy, be considered in this setting. So So now let's go through a few concepts., Embedding Dimensions: 768\n"

      "\n",
      "However, as medical knowledge grew and new treatments became available, the focus shifted towards patient-centered care. In the 1970s and 1980s, patient autonomy and informed consent became increasingly important, with the development of laws and regulations to protect patients' rights.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. Information sharing: Both the physician and patient share information about the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment options.\n",
