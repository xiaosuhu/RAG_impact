    "    {\"title\": \"Talk 1-1\", \"content\": \"No, absolutely. Doc Chapman, Dr Coolidge, everybody else who's currently on this call, thanks for the opportunity to really talk about what is extremely important and fundamental in our space, and it's the concept of shared decision making in what we do in chronic pain and management, but really going into the ethical and public health implications that we face pretty much every day, you can argue. And my hope is that, you know, I'll be able to really define what what shared decision making in pain management actually means, going to some of the bioethical principles of shared decision making in a space, and then hopefully analyze the ethical and public health implications of of shared decision making in a chronic pain space. Now the agenda is going to be as it's going to be pretty straightforward. I'll go through the introduction, go through the pain management aspect, the bioethical principles, public health and really my punchline that I usually call when in doubt. So I think there's a fundamental understanding of how history has panned out when it comes to medical decision making. And what's very interesting is, if you look back to the 1900s all the way down to early 1990s you can see that there's there was a huge gap in really understanding the psychology of that patient physician relationship. But what is obvious is that the trend is migrating towards and empowering patients to ensure that they understand why they, why they they receive the care that they did, that they do. Now, having said that is what exactly are we referring to shared as shared decision making. This idea is that the patient and the physician develops shared goals. They develop informed decision and there is patient engagement where the patient is actively involved in the decision making process about their health and the care that they receive. Now this is important, and the reason why this is important is because when shared decision making is implemented, studies have shown that it promotes patient autonomy, satisfaction and the value and preferences of the patients are recognized early to. In the journey of their care. Not shocking. You can see that there are numerous studies, numerous studies that actually talk about the role of shared decision making as it pertains to patient satisfaction, treatment adherence, reducing inequalities, cost reduction and even improving or minimizing what what has been referred to as the decision conflict process that most of us have probably encountered during our clinic visit. So now, the real summary that I you know, one of the summary that I put out here is just so as an audience, you can extrapolate some of the major findings from from the literature. Is the major benefits of shared decision making is there is improved patient and provider satisfaction, which is pretty straightforward, if applied correctly, there is better enhancements to treatment adherence, healthcare outcomes, such as reduction of pain scores, reduction of blood pressure, reduction especially in The primary care space, outcomes that pertains to chronic diseases, it's been documented to see significant improvement in those in those outcomes. Not surprisingly, when there is shared participation, there is reduction in decisional conflict and and multiple studies have reported better efficiency in running that clinical practice increased cost savings, and, like I mentioned previously, reduction of health inequalities, which we're going to get into in the public health aspect. So now we're going to migrate from this broad framework of shared decision making to looking at the evidence, the definition of the pain space, some of the potential decision considerations we should think about as we really go through this framework of shared decision making in a pain space. So not surprisingly, there are multiple studies that have been put out there regarding shared decision making in the pain space. I put this as a reference for for the audience to go back to, should you, if you want to go through some of the high yield studies, clinical trials, as well as review articles out there? But one of the ones that I that I thought was very pertinent to what we do in the chronic pain space goes back to Lisa's article and Lee and Dr Key's article about really how to think about the concept of that patient provider interaction as it relates to shared decision making. Now in the pain space, it's not any different. It's not any different from what you see in the non pain space. When you think about shared decision making, our patient population could be you could classify as pretty complicated because of the multiple etiology that can explain the pain symptoms that they have from the bio psychosocial to the physiologic changes, mechanical changes, physiological changes. But it's the same concept, right? Regardless of the etiology of the chronic pain state. It's the idea that in the in a pain space, shared decision making is sharing information between provider and patients, expressing candid opinions that is geared towards the patient's clinical outcome, and finally, and more importantly, building a consensus towards a treatment decision that will enhance the patient's outcome during your visit. Now I'm going to go through a few process that that could hopefully create a concept of shared decision making and how it can be applied even further in the pain space. The study I just present that I just displayed by Charles really does a good job going through what this encounter looks like. And from this study, which is very cited in the shared decision making space, it comes down to understanding what this definition of shared means. And like I mentioned, participants include the physician and the patient. The information sharing has to be bi directional. It's not just the physician empowering the patient about their diagnosis. It has to be the physician also receiving from the patient what the true. Understand about the diagnosis, so that bi directionality is very important, and the third component is a concept of consensus, that there is an agreement and and the agreement is more because there is understanding of preferred treatment by the patient, and also an understanding of what the conveyed diagnosis is by the physician, and obviously the final component of this is agreeing to a treatment plan that is going going to be executed.\"},\n",
    "    {\"title\": \"Talk 1-2\", \"content\": \"When is this appropriate? When is shared decision making appropriate? I think this is a great slide, a great study, because what it helps us do is, you know, really think about, at what level should we be thinking about the shared decision making, what setting? And what was great about this study was they looked at multiple areas where shared decision making processes have been implemented and and what it came down to was the characteristics of the setting where you can most likely see that a very impactful component of shared decision making is settings where there is a short time frame to make a decision, a high impact decision, like going for a surgical intervention that could be life saving, or that could be, that could be, that could result to terminal outcomes if not performed, and and a Decision characteristic setting where there is this preference sensitivity components to the conversation. And it's also found that when there is uncertainty of outcomes in a setting where the clinical practice exists, it tends to yield a very impactful indication for utilizing shared decision making. Now, if you think about the chronic pain space, whether you are a surgeon or a psychologist or a psychiatrist or an interventional pain physician or a dentist who manages pain from multiple etiology, what you recognize is in a practice that is busy, or in a practice where you're encountering so much patient, these actually apply, and I do think because of some of this characteristic, it's very easy to argue the need for shared decision making in our pain space. Now what I wanted to highlight about this slide is the study actually goes through multiple specialties, and it's the idea that the the areas or the setting where you encounter a preference sensitive dialog, A preference sensitive conversation, it is not unusual to to start considering the impact of shared decision making in that encounter, and right here, you can tell the darkest you know, the darkest color just implies that the shared decision making was used more frequently and not surprising. You can see that in oncology and a lot of other settings, such as primary care and mental health. So just that data to present out there. Now, the one thing that I thought was going to be very impactful to in trying to understand this framework is, you know, really understanding what what the evidence is. Now the conceptual framework for shared decision making, you know, this really takes me back to, you know, my public health background is the idea of understanding relationships, right? So when you think about a study and you're trying to figure out the relationship between the exposures and outcomes, you know, you think about direct acyclic graphs. I mean, these are not directed cyclic graphs. But the idea is that a very interesting conceptual framework by crepes, postulates that communication can be can impact patient outcomes and reduce symptoms, improve quality of life, improve physiological measures if you actually create direct engagement between parties and and that's almost like a no brainer, but it's an important framework to think about, because when you when you think about that busy pain practice, it's very hard to implement, because having This direct, impactful conversation without a structural framework could be, could be very tricky. Now, what gets very exciting, though, is the indirect pathway, and it's the idea that if you're actually able to create this direct path, you can indirectly start impacting the patient's secondary outcomes, or or or outcomes that you don't foresee could have been impacted. Acted like the behavioral aspect, the effective cognitive component, and that, by itself, again, creates this framework for understanding how shared decision making can be implemented in our individual practice. Now, I like this saying by a tool, Dr Gawande, and it's the idea that patients come to us, you know, not just because they need some kind of a cure, you know, they want to find meaning and understanding. What this means the most to patients is really the key to to helping them travel through this journey and and I really love this statement, because it truly creates a ground for for taking a step back every time we encounter, especially that challenging case in in our practice. Now, having said that, I'm going to dive into some of the bioethical component of of this conversation, and my hope is to go through some of the ethical consideration as it pertains to shared decision making, and also, again, go back to what a potential conceptual framework could be utilized as we think about the bioethical aspects with shared decision making in our chronic pain population. So for the purpose of this talk, and you know that the ethical part, you could dive in as deep as you can and and there's so many aspects of what we do that can be that have multiple ethical consideration. But for the purpose of this talk, I'm going to focus on these four pillars, the concept of autonomy that we're all aware of, which is respecting the patient's choice and values and decision making. Beneficence, which is promoting well being by managing the pain effectively. Non maleficence, which is avoiding interventions that may cause harm or the do no harm, phrases we were all aware of, and really justice as it comes down to ensuring equitable access to pain management and minimizing inequality. You know, these are the four pillars of the ethical consideration that I will hopefully dive into the next few for the next few slides, and then go step out so we can create a conceptual framework to further understand this better. So before going into some of those bioethical concepts, what is the real challenge here? So the real challenge, and some of you may agree, and I'm sure there's more to this, but the real challenge in a chronic pain space is like any other space, whether it's healthcare or non healthcare, patient satisfaction, or what you can refer to as customer satisfaction in a pain space, patient satisfaction, unfortunately, 79% of patients with chronic pain are dissatisfied with your care, and it's for multiple reasons. We can go into those reasons, but primarily, a lot of these dissatisfaction comes down to miscommunication or some kind of lack of understanding between parties involved, whether it's a physician and a patient, whether it's payers and a patient, whether it's even between patients and family member, there is a huge component of lack of clarity communication and dissatisfaction, and that seems to be a very, very impactful when it comes to dealing with some of the negative outcomes in our space. The other components to what creates a challenge for us on our daily basis, as a concept of using medications that could significantly be either psychoactive, addictive or again, you know, these are neuromodulatory or or or physiologically modulating drugs that can impact not just the pain state, but but other outcomes that that could be that is extremely important. And you know, we've seen this in the context of the opioid crisis that was, you know, observed in the US and now across multiple parts of the world, but, but again, this creates a challenge for us in this space. And the same thing applies to healthcare by itself. You know how sustainable it is, because you and I already know we, we all face the some of the rigors of approval for patients to even get access to the care that they deserve or or clinically justified. And again, creates another challenge for us, because here now we're looking at we're looking at that, the concept that that that when we go into our practice, these are ethical things that we need to really be very mindful of now, Now, having said that, though our ethical obligation remains the same, right so the. Central value of medicine is to ameliorate suffering in patients and chronic pain patients, cancer and non cancer pain are extremely, extremely vulnerable patients, and it's extremely important that the principles of non maleficence, beneficence, justice and and patient autonomy, respect for patient autonomy, be considered in this setting. So So now let's go through a few concepts.\"},\n",
    "    {\"title\": \"Talk 1-3\", \"content\": \"I really want to highlight this, this book, and I say this because there was in a lot of depth in content written by our own, Dr shatman, and a lot of the framework and understanding we're very, very, very detailed in in this, in this literature, in this book, and highly recommend it. So, having said that, let's talk about patient autonomy. You know, very simple understanding. Sorry, did I was there a question? Okay, so patient autonomy. Now, the concept of patient autonomy is respecting the independent wishes of the patient. Sounds straightforward. Well, not necessarily, right, because what, what the what the patient desires, may not always correlate with what the clinical outcome could be. Could could be resulted to, but it all but, but in the end, the definition is very clear. The patient has the right to refuse or accept treatment, and that's what creates the autonomy. Now, what is a challenge in our pain space, right? If you think about the patient autonomy in our space, you can you can easily tie that to patients or gradually losing control of their care, because just the disease states itself creates such an experience where, you know, there is a negative sequela that comes from just being in chronic pain state, the emotional, behavioral, social, recreational, you know, you name it, financial and also legal. Ramification, you know, it gradually chips away the patient's ability to make decision, and, and, and a lot of you who are seeing patients at multiple spaces, whether it's on the psychological part or treating headaches or back pain, neck pain, or performing surgical procedures. You can tell that a lot of these patients who are in this quantification state or or chronicity, if you want to call it, are losing autonomy every day. And it's and it's important to recognize this, because it creates a layer of challenge in this bioethical framework and not to go into the patient healthcare coverage. Now that raises a question, though, what we think is this really, is this autonomy, or are we? Are we looking into non maleficence, versus maleficence? You know, you could, you could argue multiple components of healthcare coverage, and we're going to dive into it a little bit. So non maleficence, again, the concept of do no harm, it's challenging, right? Because there is this. The concept of do no harm as a clinician is very simple. You understand the application of the therapies you're recommending to the patients, and you're minimizing every possible way of of impacting this patient negatively. However, the patient may not have access to this therapy. And the question of non maleficence, it really goes down to some of the ethical dilemma we see with payers, and I would say with healthcare administrators, right? So a patient needs a therapy, the therapy is not covered because, based on the internal laws, the internal ethos or regulatory policies created by the payers the patient may not necessarily have access to the therapy. Now, does that mean that this is maleficence? Well, the payers may not see it that way, because they they they may create a policy that they think is ethical and moral to their cooperation, and based on that policy, patients could be denied care, you know, but as a clinician, we see the opposite, right? Because we see the clinical indication, we see that there is strong evidence, there is there is clinical trials and studies that have shown that this therapy works, and from our perspective, clearly when that's when it's so clear that the evidence could support good outcome, you can, you can strongly argue that that it's at least maleficence, because maleficence suggests that you know it's wrong doing right you're not. You may not physically harm someone directly, but. It's wrong doing and over time that can, that can potentially result to harm. So again, frameworks, ethical frameworks to think about when you when we think about maleficence in our space. Now, beneficence is pretty straightforward, and it's the idea that you know, you promote well being by controlling the pain effectively and and this is the primary goal of of of that we the primary goal of chronic pain professionals as well as healthcare providers in this space. But again, we run into the same challenges, and you can when you run into a profit model enterprise where emphasis is placed on cost reduction and emphasis is placed on profitability, you really run the risk of providing adequate resources to promote patients well being, and we see similar setting in where you see similar outcomes, where beneficence is compromised because economic models are placed over therapeutic models. So again, you can kind of see the intertwined with beneficence and non maleficence. But it's the same idea that when you reduce the access to resources that patients could have utilized, you can really impact their well being. Now justice again, is that the other component I was going to really talk about, and again, it's the idea that you're ensuring equitable access to patients who are in chronic pain. You know, there's several studies that have been put out there reporting under treatment of vulnerable population, minority population, underserved population. Physicians recognize this as a concern. Historically, the amount of awareness was not as not as high, compared to moving to more recent studies, and that I consider as progress. But again, it's important to understand what can be done or or at least recognize why some of these things are present in our practice. Now, when you look at inequalities in chronic pain management, it is not surprising to see that the studies studies have reported low income education like, you know, having less education certain ethnic or minority group and race as well as gender, are significantly impacted. There's several studies reporting African Americans having having inequalities in outcome, as well as even female patients having inequalities and outcomes and when it comes to the chronic pain states, and not to forget the third party payers, who unfortunately can make decisions internally that can impact who can eventually have access to care, thereby compounding or or increasing the inequalities that we see so So, having said that, you know, I think one of the things that I want to really shift into is the framework. I'm just going to adjust my screen a little bit here in the framework. \"},\n",
    "    {\"title\": \"Talk 1-4\", \"content\": \"Now, what are the ethical framework that we should consider, consider when we think about shared decision making in our space. You've, you know, we've all seen what the pillars of bioethics in a pain space could look like. Now, what are the frameworks that we can consider to truly, truly start changing the dialog and and I truly like this article written by dinof at the British Journal of anesthesia, of anesthesia. And it's the idea of taking advantage of understanding Chaldeans framework and codigens framework is really straightforward, and it says that the purpose of of dialog, if it's centered around human flourishing, medical treatment or diagnosis, goals of care, values and benefits, and really understanding the concepts of health that one can actually aspire or, more importantly, achieve a better healthcare outcome in in a pain space and and there, you know, there's several ways to understand this. For from a medical test component, it comes down to how you interact with the patient regarding their imaging. From a human flourishing component, it goes back to how you interact with the patient, about their well being. Goals of care. It goes back to how you interact with the patient regarding what does the patient want? What what is this autonomous to them? Or am I? Am I Am I pushing this decision on the patient values and belief? Very similar concepts of health. Again, very similar. Are you communicating with the patient, whether it's through visual aids, whether it's through AI, whether it's through a structural a mental structure that ensures that the patient is a part of the care. Are you using this five components to achieve that? And and collagen framework suggests that if you can incorporate some of this five framework into your daily practice, you can most likely, or you can at least strive to achieve shared decision making process in the pains in your chronic pain space. So the other component of this, which I thought was very interesting, little bit more complicated, and I put this as a reference, so what? So we can all go back to it if you're interested, to try to try to tease out the ethical decision making process. And this was published by Anna as well as Dr shatman, a journal of pain research, looking at what the conceptual framework should be. I do think what is important to mention is you have to be able to understand what the role is as a healthcare provider and really understand the role of the patient. And the reason why that's critical is because they're interchangeable. Okay? It's almost like running statistics, right? If you understand the association between variables, you're going to be able to predict what the outcomes are. Now it's the understanding of the variable is so important. And what I like about about this presentation, about this concept, is the moral is you, one has to understand the role that they play as a healthcare provider, but more importantly, understand the role of the patient and and the happy medium is when relationship between both roles are established and communication is very clear, you can achieve a Much better, ethical conversation that can result to hopefully better healthcare outcome. So now we're going to go to the public health component of this conversation. And again, my goal would be to really highlight some of the challenges the framework, again, that we can work with, some of the processes that comes with shared decision making and and really understanding what some of the potential barriers could be with shared decision making. So again, a few papers to highlight the public health aspects of what we do in a chronic pain space. I do like the study. I like to review. I do like the review article written by Dr Steve Cohen recently on Lance, said really highlighting what the burden is for the burden of chronic pain, when the society itself, and it goes back to understanding the pathophysiology, the biopsychosocial model, really understanding how the etiology itself is not just a broken femur. You know, it's the it's the it's the social, psychological, a really good article, highly recommended and not not shocking when you talk about public health and pain, it's very difficult to ignore the opioid crisis, as that was one of the biggest public health concern that we had encountered in this space and still continue to encounter, though it's improved significantly and and then I there's another, another good article I recommend is one by males published in British Journal of anesthesia in 2019 really going through what these factors are that that could be associated with the public health related outcomes in the pain space, and I'll dive into that in the next slide and in subsequent slide. Now, the one thing I wanted to just bring up is, you know, the opioid component, because and in a chronic pain space that the opiate pandemic really shook how we thought about caring for patients and and multiple guidelines have been put in place to mitigate some of this public health concern. And the CDC continues to provide, you know, evidence based guidelines to improve communication. And this is important, because with utilizing shared decision making between you and your patient. It could, you can, one can, can. One can attain even better clinical outcome, because you get to discuss limiting initial prescription when necessary, you get to discuss use of alternative methods, such as the injections, the psychological evaluation or treatment, and then, more importantly, discuss the risk and benefits. So again, you're going into the whole concept of addressing some of the major aspect that has resulted to the pandemic, opioid pandemic in the first place. And I thought it was an important slide to communicate. Yeah. Now, when we think about chronic pain and public health, it's a very complex relationship, and I say complex because we very few studies and and I really wasn't convinced with some of the reports in the literature, partly because it's very hard to really study, but we all know it exists. And the public health component of chronic pain is a complex relationship, but it ties back to understanding the key players or variables that that is, whether directly or indirectly, associated with healthcare outcomes and in a pain space, it's not shocking to see that in in in an age group, gender, ethnic group, cultural background, socio economic background, employment status, and how all of those can has actually impacted access to care or or even ability to go back to work. And the other thing that I that I thought was worth mentioning is lifestyle and behavior and clearly the clinical outcomes some patients coming to the clinic with already more severe pain state versus others who have had access with with less severe pain states, thereby even creating a much more complex relationship. Now is that a public health crisis? Is that a public health issue? I do think a lot a lot of research still needs to be done to truly tie that relationship. What is very clear, though, is that there is a relationship between socio economic status and healthcare outcomes. There is very clear relationship between social economic outcomes and as social determinants of health. And clearly, if that relationship can result to an economic burden, one can hypothesize that you can eventually see the association with with public health and chronic pain and again, don't forget the biopsychosocial model as well. So now, having said that, the question now is, we know that there is a relationship between public health and chronic pain. Now, where does shared decision making come into play? I wanted to really go through this article because it the article did a really good job going through how shared decision making could reduce health inequalities, and it cut across all specialties, not necessarily in the pain space. And these authors, what they did was really looked at, they performed a met a systematic review and meta analysis. They utilized shared decision making models. So the study utilized shared decision making models, it was included. And what was very interesting was they looked at the population of the studies, and if the population had at least 50% that were underserved, that the studies were included in this analysis, and what was found, which I'm not going to go into details, is if you look at the forest plot of the study, was that the forest plot was favorable, favorable towards improving healthcare outcomes Among disadvantaged patients if shared decision making process was implemented. So again, these are very encouraging studies to really highlight that there is signals and there are, there's data out there suggesting that we can, we can truly utilize SDM for improving patient outcome. Now, one of the things that I just wanted to highlight in terms of thinking about what this means is, you know, again, going back to shared decision making process, you introduce a decision, the patient understands it, you present the option, you make recommendation, and then it's always important to ensure that the patient understands it. And the final goal is that a consensus is made where the clinician and patient makes a shared decision based on the clinical evidence, the patient's value and patient patient's preference. There are multiple studies that have discussed how this could be accomplished. Visual aids, AI, all have seemed to be impactful in multiple settings.\"},\n",
    "    {\"title\": \"Talk 1-5\", \"content\": \"I think it's important to remember that there are barriers to shared decision making, time constraint, knowledge gaps, cultural norms, health literacy, that the list goes on and on. But the reason why this is important is because the impact of each of these barriers vary from one setting to another, but it's important to recognize that they exist. Now I go back to this when in doubt slide, and it's really one of the things that I you know, it's hard to accomplish with our busy lives, but, you know, observe it. If you see it, observe it. Ask questions. Is analyze it and communicate it and and the reason why I always go back to this is when you think about the shared decision making space, it's such a young field. It's a very, very young field, especially in chronic pain management. And I do think that there is a lot of work to be done, and there's a potential significant impact that this could have in our space, and with that, I would like to just thank everyone for listening. Patient centered care is why we do what we do. It's truly an honor presenting this talk, and I'm looking forward to taking questions. Thank you.\"},\n",
    "    {\"title\": \"Talk 2-1\", \"content\": \"Dr scarwani, thank you very much for that kind introduction, and it's a pleasure for me to be here today, in spite of the northeaster that we're having fuel technical difficulties. Just a reminder to everyone, if you're not talking, to make sure that your phone is or your audio is muted. I'm going to start by reminding everyone that the number one predictor of a good surgical outcome is patient selection and in the management of facial pain that we're going to talk about today, with an emphasis on trigeminal neuralgia, that means that getting the proper diagnosis matched to the proper treatment is critical. With that in mind, people of a certain age, you trained at a certain time, will remember this mantra that was drilled into us, that pain is the fifth vital sign, and it took many years for the field as a whole to come to grips with the fact that pain is not the fifth vital sign, and that when a patient comes in whose main complaint is pain, We have the difficulty of depending on a patient's history and description of what they're feeling as the primary means of making a diagnosis, there is no good way to measure pain the way you can measure blood pressure or blood chemistry. Most patients who come in with facial pain will naturally attribute it to an identifiable cause, usually Dental in the case of facial pain, it is very, very rare for someone to come to see me with trigeminal neuralgia who has not been to a dentist. And in fact, it's quite rare for people to come see me who've not had root canals and teeth pulled, and this is no aspersion on the dentists for most of human history, it was not clear that pain in the face, what we would now call teregeminal neuralgia, was really something different than dental Pain. The history of trigeminal just kind of interesting. Dr David Keith pointed out in his talk that the very first article and the very first issue of what is now the New England Journal of Medicine was about trigeminal neuralgia. This has been around for as long as as human beings have been around, but our understanding of it is really only 150 200 years old, and our experience in managing it surgically is even younger than that. So to give a little bit of a review of what Dr Chang mentioned last week, picking out this diagnosis based on history is very difficult to do, and this slide is just intended to give a little bit of an idea of some of the complexity of arriving at a firm diagnosis of trigeminal neuralgia. So on the upper right, we have this very complicated hierarchy of all the different factors that can cause pain referred to the head and face. In case, there's a more focused list of of decision options down here on the lower right, and I find the one on the left here, a particularly useful decision tree differentiating between chronic, continuous pain and episodic pain, episodic unilateral pain, and finally, a way of coming to the diagnosis of probable trigeminal neuralgia.\"},\n",
    "    {\"title\": \"Talk 2-2\", \"content\": \"Over here,for dentists in particular, there are decision trees that lead to excluding all other causes of dental pain and ending up with this final recommendation, which, which I think is a good one as a take home message, if it's not clearly Dental, the next step should be to order an MRI of the brain and refer the patient appropriately. So again, just for to review a little bit of what we've heard in previous talks here, including last week with Dr Chang, common underlying conditions that can cause facial pain, dental sinuses, tumors in various locations, intracranial causes of facial pain. We're going to talk about a little bit more today. There's something called secondary trigeminal neuralgia, which is caused by a mass such as a tumor or an aneurysm. It's really not ideologically different than then. Then the type of trigeminal neuralgia we consider classic, anything that causes compression of the nerve will cause this, but we kind of separate mass lesions from the classic things that we'll talk about more today. And then there's a problem of referred pain from inside the head in other places. So again, to sum up, the symptoms can be very difficult to tease out and separate from other causes of pain. When we're talking about facial pain and trigeminal neuralgia, and we are dependent on the history of patient, because there's no real, accurate, reliable test to prove this diagnosis. There some have been proposed, but none are in general use, because none are really as reliable as a careful history the two people who historically are responsible for the beginning of our modern understanding of trigeminal neuralgia are these two. You can imagine getting ready to go to work in the morning, and having to do that to your powdered wig and so on, is really pretty amazing. This is Nicola Andre on the left, who is responsible for the name that is commonly used for this disease, titular and on the right, John Fothergill, who Dr Keith talked about a little bit in his lecture, who was a friend of Benjamin Franklin, who really was the first person to ascribe trigeminal neuralgia, and This type of facial pain to the nerves, and understand this as a nerve problem rather than a tooth problem. And that is really where our understanding began with this, leading to that article in the New England Journal that we looked at before and the treatment of patients at that time. I'm having a little bit of trouble here with my pointer. There we go. So how common is this disease? How likely are you to see it in a dental practice or a headache practice? It is actually quite a common problem, and I think it often goes unrecognized for many years as what it is, one of the reasons that many people spend long periods of time getting dental treatment before the realization is reached that this there's that this is what's actually going on. It is more common to women over the age of 40 overall present. The prevalence of this disease is as much as about one in 200 people, and it usually occurs in the lower part of the face. We'll go back in a moment into trigeminal anatomy, but in the upper or lower jaw, again, one of the reasons it is conflated with tooth pain, so a common problem and something that should be high on one's list when dealing with episodic face pain that seems to be resistant to obvious treatments. Just a refresher on the anatomy of the trigeminal nerve. The name three roots refers to the three divisions. So here you see the gasserian ganglion. Now, this is a this is a sensory ganglion. This nerve is very analogous to the dorsal root ganglia, and that the dorsal sensory nerves in the spinal canal, and like those, there are primary sensory neurons here. The anatomy and neurochemistry of this ganglion are very complex. There are many different neurotransmitters here, including things like glutamate, substance, P, C, G. ERP, and it's actually relatively poorly understood exactly what goes on in this ganglion. A number of fibers pass right through it on the way to the brain. But for our purposes, in discussing diagnosis and treatment of pain, it's important to understand that there are three main branches, the first division, which is the which is the ophthalmic branch, second division, maxillary and the third division, which is the mandibular branch. The nerve also has a complex supply to parts of the ear, which you see here, the auricular temple, temporal nerve, auricular, but is the purple area greater auricular nerve. So the upper part here is supplied by trigeminal nerve, but other nerves from the occipital branch of the occipital nerve serve other parts of the ear, and yet other parts are subserved by the vagus nerve. So ear pain is a particularly thorny problem many of these patients with facial pain, complaint of pain that radiates from the ear or is in the ear. And again, it can be difficult for the patients to distinguish exactly where the pain is originating and where it radiates to here. Again, you see the fifth nerve, the trigeminal nerve. It supplies this anterior part of the ear canal and the eardrum, the tympanic membrane here, but other nerves are involved in other places it it's interesting to note that these are mixed nerves, just like nerves in the spinal canal. So even though we generally think of the seventh nerve, facial nerve, as motor and the fifth nerve as sensory. The facial nerve has a small sensory branch and the fifth nerve has a small motor branch, which we'll see again momentarily. Within this area of trigeminal neuralgia, there is sub classification. It gets even more complicated, because classically, we think of trigeminal neuralgia as a sudden electric shock, excruciating pain that shoots down into the the upper or lower jaw, and then when it's gone, it's gone, and people are normal in between that is kind of classic, or also called type one trigeminal neuralgia. That's what we all read about in textbooks, and what we think of when in neurology and neurosurgery is trigeminal neuralgia. But it isn't always that way. It's more complicated than that. There is a second type of trigeminal neuralgia, which has the same apparent origin and etiology, which is a more constant, steady background pain. And patients have mixtures of these two. It's rare to see someone who has purely only the classic type one. So some of these decision trees are based on the idea that you either have one or the other. And if it's just the lancinating electric shock pain, we call that type one. If it's just the background pain, we call that either type two or atypical trigeminal neuralgia. But here's a classification on the left from Kim Burchill, a neurosurgeon at the Oregon Health Sciences University who bases it on predominance. So if it's more than 50% of the lancinating type, he will call that type one, more than 50% constant pain. It's type two. Another very important thing to keep in mind here is that the character of the pain can change over time, and that, especially with medication and treatment, people have a tendency to evolve from the pure, lancinating type pain to more and more of the background, steady pain in between These episodes, some patients will also complain of a subjective feeling of numbness there. So generally, as a as a sort of ballpark overview of this type one is this lancinating electric shock, excruciating pain, and type two is a more dull background pain that's there all the time. They are usually mixed together. This is also important in seeing patients and counseling them, because the electric shock landscaping, the type one symptoms, tend to respond much better to surgery.\"},\n",
    "    {\"title\": \"Talk 2-3\", \"content\": \"Now we heard a little bit of one more point I wanted to make here is that when pain is in the ear, I mentioned it's complex. One of the reasons I showed the slide about when you go through all the dental causes, send the patient for an MRI, you pick up some weird things on MRI scans that can be helpful. Obviously, if we have a tumor like a meningioma or an aneurysm, pressing. In the nerve those things are important to know about because of their own prognostic implications, but even in looking for the source of pain, here's a patient we saw who complained mainly of ear pain. It did radiate into the face, but it was mainly localized to the ear canal. Little bit unusual for trigeminal neuralgia, what this patient has what you're seeing here. This is left and right. This is the pons the brain stem. And what the arrow is pointing to is a loop of the anterior inferior cerebellar artery that's pressing on the seventh and eighth nerve complex as it goes into the internal auditory canal. This nerve is pressing on the nervous intermedius, which is the sensory branch of the facial nerve. And this is called nervous intermedius neuralgia. So you know, the the imaging is a very helpful thing to do now, before we go on about etiology. So you know, why are we talking about surgery at all? When we had a talk last week about all the different effective means of medical control of this disease, we consider surgery for this in two circumstances, either the medication doesn't work, or, number two, the medication works, but the side effects are intolerable, or both. When patients come in and say, you know, my pain is completely under control, but I just don't like taking pills. I discourage people in that situation from pursuing surgery if they do want to pursue it. I make it very, very clear that the goal is no pain, not no pills. Because what I'm going to go on and show you here is that this is a complex disease, that surgery is very helpful, that it has risks and it is not a perfect solution for everybody at this stage, if someone decides to go on to surgery, we need to understand what the etiology is of this disease to help us design A treatment that works best for each individual patient. So what is the cause of trigeminal neuralgia? We've talked a little bit about things pressing on the nerve. Here's one pressing on another nerve. I'll show you the more classic findings of an MRI of patients with trigeminal neuralgia in a moment. But the answer is, we don't really understand this disease very well. There are a lot of theories. Most of them are just that. They're hypotheses. They're very difficult to prove. It's circumstantial evidence. We don't have a lot of pathological specimens. There are not a lot of controlled trials of different things with this disease, and we, above all, don't have a good animal model of trigeminal neuralgia. There are models that depend on artificially injuring the trigeminal nerve in rabbits, rats and so forth. That's not quite the same thing as trigeminal neuralgia. Looking through the veterinary literature, there is something called trigeminal mediated head shaking, which occurs in horses, but it's it's movement, that it's head shaking, it's not obvious that it's pain, and it's not associated with what I'm showing you here, demyelination. So we don't have a good animal model. And I you know people say, Well, how would you know if the animals in pain? If you see a patient with classic type one trigeminal neuralgia walk into your office, and you can, you can see when they have an attack, these folks will stop speaking in the middle of a sentence and wince when they have an attack, it's, it's something that in an animal you'd be able to see, and there isn't anything comparable. So that hamstrings us a bit in working on solutions to this problem and even in understanding its underlying neurophysiology and neurochemistry. This is a hypothesis as to what's going on most people with classic trigeminal neuralgia appear to have demyelination near the area where the trigeminal nerve joins the brain stem at the root, area where peripheral type Schwann cell myelin gives way to Central oligodendroglio. Myelin seems to be a sensitive area. The idea is basically that this is a short circuit between the large myelinated fibers that subserve light touch and position and the small unmyelinated pain fibers. And that when the myelin is destroyed here, a couple of things happen. You can get direct spread of excitation between the axons here, from one to another, you can get abnormal sprouting and connections between the different types of fibers, and you can even, because of conduction block, because action potentials are blocked in this area, they can kind of reverberate and echo and cause abnormal pain signals. Mean, why is all this relevant? Well, anything that decreases flow of information through this area, that decreases neurological activity in this area, will decrease this abnormal signaling getting into the pain fibers. So what's happening here is things that should normally be sensed as light touch or position or movement are being sensed as pain instead. And if you can decrease the amount of that normal sensory information going up the wrong channel, that will help with the pain. Surgery is focused on solving that problem in a couple of ways, as as well about we're about to look at. So this is an actual pathology specimen from a patient, presumably post mortem with trigeminal neuralgia. The black is myelin. Brain stem is on this side. This is the nerve. And you see this area of extensive demyelination. So this is what this looks like under the microscope. There's also in some people. This is new information. This is a paper from last year by Dr Chris Colley, who's here at Mass General now showing that there are some people who have a predisposition based on certain mutations in GABA channels, both GABA neurotransmitter channels and ion channels, that seem to set them up to be more sensitive to this, and this perhaps explains the reason why we will see people who on MRI scan have things touching their trigeminal nerves, but have no symptoms from it, and also an observation that not most, But many people with trigeminal neuralgia, have other nerve pain syndromes as well. So clearly, there's a couple of things that can set people up. I'm about to show you some of them. And my own experience with this is that in some people, this is a three hit disease, you have a general susceptibility like this. You have the demyelination that I just showed you. And I think in some people, there's a match that sets off the powder keg, and in some cases, that may be the dental work, some initial trigger of the pain. So I don't think that it's always the case that people get root canals because there was a misdiagnosis. I think that happens. But I think in some people that pain from of dental origin may be what sets this all off, particularly if they have the other Double hits of the demyelination from compression and the genetic susceptibility. What else can cause demyelinization? Well, multiple sclerosis is a disease of the myelin, and indeed, in about 2% of multiple sclerosis patients, we have trigeminal neuralgia, often as a presenting symptom. This is an example of that. So it is. It is definitely more common in people with MS. This is a patient I saw recently, and what you're looking at here is an MRI focused on demyelination. These white areas on the MRI are Ms plaques in other parts of the brain, looking up from the feet left and right. Here you see an MS plaque in the pons on the opposite side. And here you see an MS plaque. This is exactly where the trigeminal nerve is joining the pons. And here on this you can see the demyelination, not only in the nerve, but where the nerve enters into the brainstem. Here, this patient had actually had surgery for this, which didn't really work, and came back to me for another procedure. But this can be extremely difficult to treat. Some of these short circuits in patients like this happen centrally after the different nerve fibers have diverged, making it more complicated, and some can have trigeminal neuralgia from far downstream up in the cortex. But again, something to think about because of the relatively high association of trigeminal neuralgia and Ms.\"},\n",
    "    {\"title\": \"Talk 2-4\", \"content\": \"This is the Schweitzer hypothesis, which I have no idea how to test this, but an interesting observation, getting back to this note that this is a uniquely human disease. Why would that be? There is something else that is unique about anatomy in this part of the body in humans, and that is this basal angle of the skull, related to the fact that we walk upright. So in quadrupedal animals, this is flat, and the nerve would run straight like so in humans, there's a nearly right angle here, and the nerve has to negotiate this right angle. Now, keep in mind that MRI scans are done with patient lying flat, and you can imagine that when they sit up, things change, putting gravity to work here. You can see on the right here, these are primates, so from lemur to monkey to lesser apes to chimps and to humans. You see how this angle changes and. The lower left here. This is an MRI of patient. What you're seeing here, this is the pons. This white is spinal fluid. Black here is bone. This is the actual trigeminal nerve crossing over this space from the brain to the bone. This is the where the ganglion is. And you see how it's kind of suspended here on the asymptomatic side in this patient, it looks unencumbered on the right side, this is the superior cerebellar artery pushing down on the nerve right at that point. So one can speculate that the nerve is under tension, and, for that reason, more susceptible to compression. Here, again, this is my own hypothesis as to why this occurs just in humans. If anyone can think of a good way to test this, please let me know. But interesting to look at. Here's another example of the same thing. Patient that I have actually on the list for surgery at this point, you can kind of see the brain here. This is the trigeminal nerve. The arrows pointing to where that nerve is bowed by the superior cerebellar artery pushing down on it, and this pressure seems to cause demyelination, leading to the other symptoms. So there are really three ways to address this problem with surgery, and they fall into these three categories, corrective surgery designed at fixing the underlying problem. Ablative surgery, which is intentional infliction of some damage on the nerve, to try to block that traffic that's passing through the short circuit. And modulatory to try to modify that traffic in some way to help relieve the pain the historically original one is actually the corrective surgery. And this is one slide kind of giving a brief overview of the history of neurosurgical treatment of trigeminal neuralgia. This is Walter dandy, James Gardner, and this is Peter Janetta. These are three of the the Giants in this field. In the early part of the 20th century, there was the impression that trigeminal neuralgia and other types of facial pain were caused by nerve compression, and that this could be relieved by going in and and relieving that compression, and that was done by an open craniotomy, either in front of the ear, which is where the nerve enters the face through the bone here, where that trigeminal ganglion is located, or from the back of the head, going up to where the nerve exits from the brainstem and heads forward in the course of this, things were often found. The basic idea here was to cut the dura over this to free it up. And I think in some cases, the surgery caused enough damage to the nerve that basically it was the manipulation of the nerve that relieved the pain, rather than the decompression, per se. But the observation was made that sometimes things were pressing on the nerve, and in particular, Walter dandy made a note that he often found a blood vessel up against nerve. He was really looking for small tumors, aneurysms and other things, but he made that remark and didn't really follow up on it. James Gardner, who was chief of neurosurgeon Cleveland Clinic at the time, was the first to focus in on this vascular compression of cranial nerves as a cause, not only of trigeminal neuralgia, but also of Hemi facial spasm. When it was the seventh nerve involved and it was the first to publish on this, Peter genetta sort of made his reputation on this idea of microvascular decompression and microvascular or of blood vessel compression of cranial nerves as the etiology, not just of trigeminal neuralgia and any facial spasm, but even of things like essential hypertension and diabetes. So you know when, when you have the old saying, when you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail. Nonetheless, the disease or the procedure, the procedure, the that we use to correct the vascular compression, is often called the genetta procedure. Dr Janetta trained at UCLA about 12 years before I was there, and his teacher, Robert Rand, was still there when I was training. And if you called this the genetic procedure, in front of Robert Rand, he would just blow a gasket. He didn't invent it. It was Gardner who invented it. And indeed, if you look back, these are two articles in The Journal of neurosurgery. This is James Gardner from 1962 reporting on his experience of microvascular decompression, and in turn, interestingly, going back and quoting Walter dandy. So all three of those people I just showed you are in this slide as the the idea being that blood vessels compressing these nerves and causing. Demyelination, or the underlying etiology of these diseases. And this is Dr Janetta initial paper on this, which gained him that lifelong reputation.\"},\n",
    "    {\"title\": \"Talk 2-5\", \"content\": \"So this procedure that's being described here, microvascular decompression, falls into that first category that I mentioned, the correct corrective, ablative and modulatory. This is a procedure that's designed to correct the underlying problem. If we think that the demyelination is being caused by compression by a blood vessel, you go in and you move the blood vessel, presumably allowing the nerve to heal and the myelin to regrow. What's interesting to keep in mind looking at the next few slides, though, is that the pain relief from this operation does not require the myelin to regrow, which presumably would take weeks or months. The pain relief occurs right away, and it is not clear why that happens again, having no model, we're not quite sure why pain is relieved immediately. It may be that handling the nerve is enough to cause damage to it and block signals. That's one idea that's called the micro rhizotomy effect idea. Some of my colleagues here disagree with that, and think that it is actually the blood vessel continuing to pulsate against the bare part of the nerve, the demyelinated part of the nerve, that's actually setting off action potentials, and that removing that pulsatility will quiet things down, but again, not Clear doesn't affect how we do the surgery. This is an example that I'm going to show you of an actual patient who came to see me in the office with refractory trigeminal neuralgia and and then ended up coming in on an emergency basis because his pain had simply become impossible to control. So we actually took him to the OR urgently, to do a microvascular decompression, which I'm about to show you in his MRI. Here you can see, this is his trigeminal nerve. This is the superior cerebellar artery from above, and the anterior inferior cerebellar artery from below. And you can see they're coming together on the nerve. You can almost see right there where the nerve is thinned out. And here's a coronal view of the same thing. What I'm going to show you here is the actual surgery that we did. I have about a two and a half minute video here, which we'll see if we can get to work.\"},\n",
    "    {\"title\": \"Talk 2-6\", \"content\": \"Okay, again, I'm, I'm not sure. Okay, let me stop sharing and go back. Hang on for a moment. So somehow I need to, let's see share screen. I'm going to go to screen two, and there we go. Is that better? Okay, yep, you're okay. Now, okay, so what you're seeing here actually, you can see the motor route of the trigeminal right there. You can see the indentation in the nerve. Here's the artery, the superior cerebellar artery, and and here we are. You can see the artery is much smaller now that spasm from handling the artery. We'll get back to that at the end. This is a ball of Teflon fibers that we've made and pushing into place to keep that artery propped up away from the nerve, as well as away from the brain stem, so it's kind of wedged in the corner where the nerve joins the brainstem and held in place there by pressure from the nerve the artery and this arachnoid over it. You'll see, we're going to just open that arachnoid a little bit more here, and you can see to the left there, the view of the artery still, still up there, the dent in the nerve. Now we're going to go to the other side, the anterior inferior cerebellar artery. On this side, we actually put in two little pledges. That was the first one, second one going in here, and then from manipulation, both of these arteries are in a little bit of spasm. So the final step here, after we kind of irrigate everything out, is we're going to come in with a little Papaver, and which is a medication that will instantly reverse the spasm. And here we come with that squirting the pattern in there. And you can see the nerve now nicely padded on both sides, the arteries been pushed away from it. This patient left the hospital two days later, pain free. So these are very, very interesting looking and gratifying cases when you can do this because you've actually fixed the underlying problem. Sometimes that's not possible. Either it's a patient with MS, or there is no obvious nerve compressing it, or there are other reasons why people are not candidates for craniotomy. There are the people who prefer not to have a craniotomy. And then we turn to ablative strategies, which are designed to impede that traffic flow through the abnormal part of the nerve that can be done at the level of the ganglion, the sensory ganglion with heat, which is a radio frequency rhizotomy, with pressure, which is a balloon compression rhizotomy, or with glycerol injection, or it can be done at level of the root with radio surgery, which is external beams of radiation, a non invasive treatment of these glycerol is almost Never used anymore. It depended on positioning of the patient very heavily, and glycerol getting into the wrong place can be a bad thing. The other three are in active use here. Radio Frequency rhizotomy and balloon compression rhizotomy are both designed to impede traffic through the nerve, but they work through different means. So both of these involve placing a needle through the foramen o valley from the cheek. In the case of radio frequency rhizotomy, we're coagulating part of the nerve, and so we first have to map it with electrical stimulation. Patient needs to be awake to report that they're feeling this in the correct place, and then we use heat to destroy that part of the nerve or partially destroy it. And it's indiscriminate as to the different fiber types that are affected by this pressure works on a physiologic basis. This is again a needle through the foramen o Valley. This is a balloon that's been inflated with a dye so that you can see it when you're in the right place and have the correct shape, it looks like Edward monks the screen, which is very appropriate, I thought. And this works physiologically, this complex diagram here, but basically the pressure has a greater effect on the myelinated than on the unmyelinated fiber. So by damaging the myelinated fibers, you're reducing the source of the aberrant, aberrant signals that are traveling up the pain fibers. That is an outpatient procedure does not the balloon, does not require the patient to be awake, and they can go home the same day. Okay, both of those are highly effective. We'll get back to efficacy at the end. The third one that I mentioned is radio surgery. This is a non invasive treatment originated using the gamma knife, but cyber knife, or linear accelerator, these all work, and they basically cause inflammation in the root of the nerve. They all take weeks, two months to see the full effect. Presumably, there is some change that accompanies this inflammation, which, as it heals over time, is kind of like putting a patch on that short circuit in the nerve. And you see some of our results that we've had here, which are similar to results using radiosurgery and other centers. Finally, there's neuromodulation. This is the idea that you could use electrical stimulation to block the pain in the nerve, and this is the area that I think is most attractive in some ways, because it's less invasive than a craniotomy and less destructive than a rhizotomy. And it is not a new idea, as you see here. The idea is about 2000 years old. I have a little video of this but, but I don't need to play that just for time. I'll just move on here. But this, this is a Pacific Electric ray that that I shot a little video of off the coast of Catalina a few years back. You probably wouldn't want to go around with this on your face, but it's been well known for a long time that that electrical shots and stimulation can block pain. Now it's not again that this is a new idea. So here, here's a summary from 2007 of attempts to use electrical stimulation to modulate pain using the leads at the peripheral branches, at the ganglion or at the root. None of this has reached general use. There are people who use multiple stimulators of peripheral branches. It's a lot of hardware. It has limited efficacy, and so is not commonly used. There's even at one time, as shown in this paper from 1995 from Ron Young. By the way, if you notice how many of these papers written by single authors, you know, it's amazing. You never these days author lists are longer than the abstracts. It's quite interesting to see the number of single author papers that used to exist. But in 1995 this was a system developed by Medtronic called Quinta trigeminal. The idea was to put this lead into the root through the foramen ovale, so as to go through the foramen ovale into the root of the nerve. To use electrical stimulation, it was about 50% effective. It helped about half of the patients to relieve about half of their pain, and in return for that, they had a permanent wire implanted in a pacemaker. The technology was fairly primitive at that time, a single electrode, so it had limited programmability. Well, these days we have all kinds of newer devices that we can put in. This is an epidural cortical stimulator. These are deep brain stimulators. This is something called stim wave. It's a device that uses induction to pick up its power from an external source. So there's lots of this. None of this has been applied to facial pain, and in particular, we've concentrated today, I'm talking about trigeminal neuralgia. But neuropathic pain is also something that we see commonly, for which none of the things that I've shown you for trigeminal knowledge work particularly well. And one would expect that something that can cause that can do stimulation the nerve root would work better. And in fact, you know, our modern DBS technology was developed based on this idea. In other words, we would, in the old days, when we did deep brain simulation for Parkinson's or tremor, we would stimulate through the electrodes, confirm that we had a good effect, and then burn a hole. There. We've moved on from that to not burning holes anymore. Now we have permanently implantable stimulators, but in the case of facial pain, we're still burning holes. And it would be very interesting to be able to apply this modern technology to this. And I'll just tell you that I've been a bit frustrated that none of the companies produce these things are interested in touching this area for reasons that are not entirely clear, but I think this is an active area for development and future research. So finally, outcomes, how well does this work? The things that I've showed you, the corrective and the ablative, all are fairly effective. For MVD, there's 70 to 80% long term complete pain relief. That one out of three patients will have recurrence, generally after many years. Why that is is not entirely clear. Things shift around. New vessels come to compress the nerve. Doesn't seem to be that. TEF. On ball, moving out of the way, but you know, again, this is about the best you can get, and this is considered the gold standard. It's non destructive, and it has a fairly good efficacy for a long term rhizotomy is very effective at short term relief, but it comes at the cost of numbness, and it comes at the cost of the fact that peripheral nerves heal, so that the pain tends to come back after a few years. Now, you can repeat this any number of times you want, but the sensory loss increases with each repetition. And finally, you can end up with something that akin to phantom limb pain called anesthesia Dolorosa, where people have both numbness and pain, so you use this sparingly and as needed. Finally, the radio surgery also works slightly less well than rhizotomy. It's a great choice for people who don't want invasive procedures done.\"},\n",
    "    {\"title\": \"Talk 2-7\", \"content\": \"And it also, like other forms of risottomy tends to occur. In this case, you're limited to two treatments because of the amount of radiation that you're allowed for a lifetime. And the final thing to note is that starting with one of these does not commit you to that as your only treatment. For example, if you were to use radiosurgery and later, the patient decides to come back for an MVD, it does not appear to affect the efficacy of the MVD, so it's good thing for patients to know. And finally, I'm going to come back to this point that I made at the beginning. The pain is not the fifth vital sign. It's a complex phenomenon. It has no susceptive aspects. It has affective aspects. In fact, deep brain simulation for pain has been shown to work best on the affective aspects. And for this reason, all of the surgery needs to be put into the context of the whole patient. These folks are at increased risk of depression, anxiety, sleep disorders, and if you can't treat these, you're not giving effective treatment to the patient. So for that reason, you know, we prefer to treat this as a team approach, of which surgery is one component. I've given you sort of a quick introduction to how we apply surgery, mainly to try Gemma Morales and facial pain. I think it's a good option for patients who are carefully selected. Again, the goal is control of pain and and again, very important to consider the context of the pain is occurring in and manage expectations with that. I'm going to wrap up for now and leave some time for questions. \"},\n",
    "    {\"title\": \"Talk 2-8\", \"content\": \"Yep. So the first question I see here is an MSD, myelination level, CNS, or both central and peripheral. It seems the answer to that is, it seems that it's demyelination right at that entry zone that causes this. Now presumably there are parts farther downstream, so if you have demyelination in the pain nucle And the thalamus, or even the cortex, in theory, that can cause it. But as I showed you in that one slide, most commonly it's demyelination right at that entry zone where there's this, there's something special about the transition area between Schwann cells and oligodendrome. It seems to make it more sensitive to this. So in general, when patients present with tn type symptoms, it's either right there or immediately inside in this in the central tract of the of the trigeminal nerve. So in that close area, the second question is asking about in patients with type one or two trigeminal neuralgia, can blame an event such as dental treatment for the start of their symptoms? Legally, there seems concept breaking the glass and patient develops Tn is a glass ready to be broken, the collision performance procedure that triggers tn can be held liable for the result. Well, you know, I'm not a legal scholar, and this is a general part of human psychology that Ron you may be able to comment, but you know, we have people who have benign tumors of the spinal cord who will say that they're absolutely convinced that this happened because they fell playing baseball. I mean, it's a natural thing for people to want to ascribe a problem to a particular thing that happened to them. And there just isn't any support for this. Nor is there any way for a dentist to predict that something he does is going to set off something like this. So, you know, again, I'm trying to avoid being a expert witness for things like this, but I don't think that that someone trying to sue a dentist for causing trigeminal neuralgia would get very far with it. If you have someone experienced with trigeminal neuralgia can say that's what it is. I mean, I'm speculating that in some people. Of this seems to be a trigger that can set it off. But again, you know, some of this is, is kind of unproven impression from from seeing lots of patients like this, I wouldn't be terribly worried about this. The next question, any estimate on how much the brain moves inside the skull? Very interesting question, you know, again, it's hard to measure that without putting a hole in. Once you put a hole in, air gets in. Things definitely do move, and I have mapped that it can beat by a couple of millimeters. Dr Janetta, who I introduced before, would teach you that if you as a surgeon, go in there and don't find a blood vessel pressing on the nerve, it's because you haven't looked hard enough. And he was quite serious about that. And he was also serious about the fact that when you go in there at surgery, the patient's lying flat, you're draining spinal fluid, that the position of the patient affects this, not just gravity, but you know, we're looking we're used to look at MRI scans as though we're looking at the patient's face, but in reality, that's the way we display the MRI scan. Is not the way the position the patient is positioned during the scan. Furthermore, when you move your head around, these structures are moving. The spinal cord is twisting and moving as your head turns on the spinal column, the vessels there, which are attached down below to the first cervical vertebrae are moving to some extent. So these anatomic relationships change, not just with gravity, but with movement. You know exactly how much would be difficult to measure, but based on the movement of spinal fluid down into the fecal sac when people stand up, I would guess that it probably is, is a few millimeters on the order of two to three millimeters. Finally, when a patient presents a bilateral tn symptoms, do we suspect ms or different, different diagnosis, bilateral ms or bilateral trigeminal neuralgia? Immediately raises suspicion that this is not trigeminal neuralgia, and if you remember back to some of those early slides on differential bilateral pain was one of the things that sent you down another path of that decision tree. So it's possible, it's actually very common for us to see people with trigeminal neuralgia who have vascular compression on their MRI scan that's on both sides, but only have symptoms on one for reasons that aren't clear. I think you always have to rule out Ms, and I have seen people who clearly have both things, who have vascular compression and MS, where it is the vascular compression that's the cause of trigeminal neuralgia. When you have two fairly common situations, you can get that. So I think that bilateral pain would steer you away from this being tn at all, but I think it's necessary to rule these things out. And again, getting an MRI scan is worth, you know, a room full of neurologists, and I mentioned that it's not as successful for type two. That's true for type two, i The number one thing is managing patient expectations. So if someone comes in and their pain is predominantly this constant background pain, I will immediately tell them that that is less likely to respond, not zero, but that it's less likely to respond than the classic symptoms that being said, I would still offer any of these three. There are not clear data that show that one is better than or that one of these three approaches, the corrective, ablative or modulator, that that that one of them is better than the other, so that any of the surgical approaches work more or less well for that type when I expect the outcome to be not as good, though, I prefer not to jump right to the most invasive treatment. In other words, you have to balance risk and benefit. If you expect your benefit to be less, you want your risk to be less also. So in general, for people like this, I'll have a discussion about it, and I would steer more towards a rhizotomy as a good balance between efficacy and risk. Let's see. And there's a question with post MVD recurrence, would you go back in and do MVD again? Well, it's always a consideration. I've done many repeat mvds. You know, it's always easy to criticize what other people do. I've often gone in and found that things have shifted around, that there's a vessel there that wasn't found. The first time I had one patient ran back in the the Teflon fluff was not there at all. It had presumably fallen out and gone someplace. So MVD is definitely consideration again, if Dr Janetta were here that he would tell you that you missed something. Go back and do it again. So absolutely, but these things work in any order that you. Do them. And so many patients are reluctant to have another MVD. And those patients I would offer either of the others, either a radio surgery procedure or a rhizotomy.\"},\n",
    "    {\"title\": \"Talk 2-9\", \"content\": \"We have other questions. One other question that came in from the chat that I'll read, Is there a correlation between time from onset of trigeminal neuralgia to surgical intervention and outcome? That's an excellent question. The answer really seems to be no. You know, I've had people with pain for many, many years that either went undiagnosed or they were reluctant to have it treated and and the answer is no. Why? That is may relate to, you know, our poor understanding of the etiology here, as I mentioned, when you do an MVD, if this is really caused by demyelination, you would not expect it to immediately be myelinated again. And so when people get pain relief, it's from something else. It's either from handling the nerve and blocking the pain impulses coming through, which is not going to depend on how long it's been going on, or it is, as some people theorize, that the nerve or the vessel pulsating on that bare, unmyelinated nerve, is actually setting off action potentials, so there's not a clear correlation with duration of symptoms prior to the surgery. What does get damaged is the patient's psychosocial situation, and so people have been living with pain for years and years develop compensatory mechanisms in their lives that may be difficult to reverse. I think there is such a thing is too soon. I think that someone comes in with trigeminal neuralgia that started six weeks ago and has not had a fair trial of medication, that's too early go to surgery, but there's no upper limit on that, and I don't counsel patients who've had this for 10 years that they should not have surgery or that it's going to make a difference in their outcome. \"},\n",

    "    {\"title\": \"Talk 3-2\", \"content\": \"My disclosure slide of of note, I really hate opioids for chronic pain, and I've testified against opioid manufacturers. So I'm clinically trained as a rheumatologist, and I almost always start with this slide. This isn't as relevant for headache, because, again, we don't commonly when someone comes in with a headache, we don't commonly think it's something wrong in their brain or their head, although we rule out things like brain tumors, but in when pain presents in other areas of the body, people have a tendency to think that you can see pain on an x ray or an MRI. And I'm just going to again, I'm old, so I'm going to give you a little bit of historical view of what we now call nociplastic pain, and talk about a couple different areas, about post war pain syndromes and post infectious syndromes that you probably don't hear much about, but I think help really demonstrate the breadth of sort of this construct, and the fact that, although I'm here as a pain researcher talking to you about how we think of this in the field of pain, this syndrome of nociplastic pain clearly extends well outside the classic field of chronic pain. But until the 1990s or so, we actually did think that you could see pain on an x ray. We thought that the person on the left that has an entirely normal knee X Ray would never have pain, and the person on the right that has bone on bone, osteoarthritis would always have pain. And it's not that surprising to most people that 10 or 15% of people with an X ray like the one on the left have some pain, because there's a lot of things that you wouldn't see on a plane x ray. But it is surprising to most people that don't do research in conditions like osteoarthritis that 30 or 40% of the people in the United States that have this X ray don't have any pain. They have bone on bone, they've lost all their cartilage, and they don't have any pain and and so I'm going to talk today about nociplastic Pain in the in the research into nociplastic pain has not just helped us understand how and why these individuals with without anything demonstrably wrong with their knee, can have pain. It also helps us explain why so many people that have severe anatomic damage in the periphery do not have pain. So this is basically my career of 35 or so years of being trained as a physician, I was trained as a rheumatologist, that osteoarthritis was the classic peripheral pain syndrome, and it wasn't until the 1990s that studies in low back pain and osteoarthritis started to show how poor the relationship was between what you saw on an x ray or An MRI and whether someone was experiencing pain or not, and when we see people that have pain that you can't see anything wrong on an x ray or an MRI, we immediately think that they must have prominent psychological factors like anxiety or depression or catastrophizing causing their pain. But it turns out that that's actually usually not the case. I'm not trying to deny the import of psychological factors in chronic pain, but they don't usually cause chronic pain, and some of the therapies that we thought worked really well 30 or 40 years ago, like NSAIDs and acetaminophen and opioids and even joint replacement surgery, actually often do not lead to pain relief, and the latest Cochrane meta analyzes suggest that the effect size of NSAIDs is actually quite modest. It's point 3.4 but NSAIDs in osteoarthritis of the knee don't work any better than a drug like pregabalin works in fibromyalgia. All of our analgesic drugs have, at best, small to modest effect sizes, no matter where we use them. So I'm going to talk a little bit about fibromyalgia, but more use it as a metaphor, rather than as a standalone diagnosis. Again, in the 1990s when I was being trained, people didn't really believe that Fibromyalgia was a real disease. The first criteria for fibromyalgia appeared in 1990 they require that people had widespread pain plus a certain number of tender points. These are areas that if you apply about nine pounds of pressure in these 18 regions of the body and someone says they hurt, that's considered a positive tender point. We didn't know at the time these criteria were developed, that. Women are a lot more tender than men, and because of that, these criteria inadvertently almost always identified females that these 1990 criteria, 93% of the individuals that would meet criteria for fibromyalgia in United States or anywhere else were female. Because this, these criteria unknowingly sort of bias the diagnosis towards female by requiring a certain amount of tenderness. The newer criteria for fibromyalgia that don't require a tender point count, fibromyalgia is only about one and a half or two times more common in women than in men, and that's true of almost every chronic pain condition, not just fibromyalgia, but over the last 30 to 40 years, there's been a pretty dramatic sea change in how conditions like fibromyalgia are thought of, going from conditions where people didn't even believe that these individuals were experiencing pain to now five or so years ago, where The iesp, the international group of pain researchers formally voted and said there's a third mechanism of pain. Unfortunately, they called it nociplastic pain, and so I don't like the term, but I like the fact that the international group of pain researchers formally voted and sort of codified this concept, that this third mechanism, or descriptor of pain, nociplastic pain, is very common and very important in the field of chronic pain, and that one of the ways to identify these individuals with nociplastic Pain is they don't just have pain. They have other symptoms coming from the central nervous system, because first and foremost, nociplastic pain seems to be a CNS driven problem, not a peripherally driven problem. And so I've been using this analogy for about 20 or so years. I recently did a friendly debate with Michael gold, who is an incredible sort of preclinical peripheral pain researcher, talking about the interplay between peripheral and central factors. And I asked Michael if he thought this analogy was apt, and he actually thought it was okay, so I'll continue to use it. And that is that the amount of pain that someone is experiencing is like the allowedness of an electric guitar. And there's two ways you can make an electric guitar louder. You can either strum the strings harder, or you can turn up the amplifier, and the strings of the electric guitar are analogous to all the different types of sensory nerves that we have going to different areas of the body that are picking up heat or cold, or picking up nociceptive input, or picking up where your joint is in space. But any of this information, in order for it to be felt as pain, has to go up through the spinal cord and all the way up to the brain before it can be felt as pain. And humans have fairly robust descending pathways, and the inhibitory pathways, the descending analgesic pathways, are typically more active than the descending facilitator pathways, and because of this, these pathways inhibit the upward transmission of a lot of information, a peripheral input that wouldn't serve any adaptive purpose. Most of you are probably sitting in a chair while you're listening to this talk. You have no susceptors Firing constantly in your back and your buttocks, but it's not of any adaptive purpose for you to feel this is pain. I mean, because of that, most of you have enough descending analgesic activity so that you're not feeling pain right now. But I joke about this when I give talks to groups of patients or even groups of providers, that the length of time that you can sit in a chair before your back and your buttocks starts hurting is actually a good marker of like, what your personal amplifier is set at. And there's marked differences in individuals with respect to their amplifier setting. And it turns out that women, on average, have a much higher amplifier setting than men, and this is probably one of the big reasons that women have about one and a half to two times the rate of any type of chronic pain than men. Is it simply that they're in the central nervous system. Women are more pain sensitive and they're also more sensory sensitive, and I'm going to talk a lot about this, but no so plastic pain. People are not just more sensitive to pain with respect to the brain and the amplifier, they're more sensitive to the brightness of lights, the loudness of noises, odors, and in recent studies that we're just finishing right now where we've looked done quantitative sensory testing in a number of different disease states to see what predicts when people are going to respond to surgery if They have pain or what restricts if they're going to respond to a new Dmart or anti rheumatic drug, if they have an autoimmune disease, people's perception of how bright a light is when we shine it in their eyes is a very strong predictor of non responsiveness to for example, surgery when people have. Of joint replacement surgery, and so this nociplastic pain, one of the first things that I want to emphasize is these individuals are not just pain sensitive.\"},\n",
    "    {\"title\": \"Talk 3-3\", \"content\": \"They're sensory sensitive to any type of sensory stimuli, and this is responsible for a lot of the symptoms that these individuals experience. They also, if you look at the far right side of the screen, the two left types of pain we've known about forever, nociceptive pain and neuropathic pain. But again, we know that these individuals with centralized or no the plastic pain, their pain is more widespread. They are sensitive to other types of sensory stimuli, and they have these other CNS symptoms like sleep problems, fatigue, memory problems and mood problems that are core to nociplastic pain. And so I'm just going to talk really briefly and rapidly about clinical studies, mechanistic studies, treatment implications, and then very briefly about some of the controversies. So again, you're seeing this term more and more. This is a lancet article some of us wrote about nociplastic pain, and there's agreement about the fact that this pathophysiologically, there's augmented CNS, pain and sensory processing, as well as the fact that these other symptoms, like fatigue, sleep problems, memory problems and mood problems are core to this kind of pain. They're not just an ancillary thing, and that the in many studies that we and other groups are doing at where we look at nuance that have nociplastic pain and children are adolescents, these symptoms typically antedate the pain. Sleep Problems are usually the first things we see in kids or adolescents that are on their way to developing new nose of plastic pain. Then you see the fatigue and the memory problems. Then you see the pain. But again, more and more studies are showing that these other CNS symptoms are really core to this syndrome. Another new set of terms you're going to hear more and more are chronic, overlapping pain conditions, a parallel term that is being used more outside of the United States, our primary pain conditions. This is a ICD 10 ICD 11 term. And primary pain essentially means that the pain is the primary problem. It's not due to osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis or some other disease that the pain seems to be the primary problem. The classic chronic overlapping pain conditions are headache and tension. Headache is fully in the cop C's. Migraine is sort of half in and half out. I'll talk a little bit about that, but we can talk about in the question and answer session, fibromyalgia, irritable bowel TMD, bladder pain syndrome, low back pain, endometriosis, these are all considered to be part of chronic overlapping pain conditions. And notice one of these here, chronic fatigue syndrome, the pain is not nearly as prominent in CFS as the fatigue, the memory problems and the sleep disturbance. And we see that in a lot of these nociplastic pain syndromes that not all of the individuals have pain as their most prominent complaint in some individuals, the memory problems, the sleep problems, the fatigue are actually more troublesome. And in addition to these conditions where nociplastic Pain is front and center, we know these same nociplastic mechanism plays significant roles in all pain conditions, about a third of individuals that start with an autoimmune disease like rheumatoid arthritis or lupus will develop superimposed central sensitization or nociplastic pain, and this occurs in sickle cell disease, erectanlose syndrome, any pain syndrome, over time, will become more and more centralized and more and more nociplastic This is a recent review article we wrote in Nature Reviews neurology, talking about the sort of pathogenic features of nociplastic pain as well as the treatments that work. And again, I'm going to talk about a couple of these very briefly to give you a broader context. Those of you in the field of pain think of pain, but I want to broaden this a little bit and talk about that these fibromyalgia, like pain conditions, can occur after people are deployed to war, after people have certain types of infections. And now we're realizing that long COVID is probably one of these sort of nosoplastic syndromes. In addition to, again, what you all know and what I'm going to mainly focus on, is that this is often a comorbidity in chronic pain conditions. In this Nature Reviews article, we talked about all the different risk factors for developing nociplastic pain. And again, I'm just going to talk about a couple of these, because most pain researchers are not familiar with these, but they help you, give you a broader context about what nociplastic syndromes really are. So it turns out that infections can trigger any of these conditions in approximately 10% of individuals. So the type of infections that historically we've known trigger a post. Infectious syndrome would be Epstein Barr Virus, Lyme disease. A number of different infections are have been historically known to cause this, and it's only infections that cause diffuse pain and fatigue that lasts for a week or so that trigger this that like common upper respiratory infections, like the common cold, don't trigger the development of sort of chronic fatigue syndrome or post infectious syndromes, but things like Epstein Barr Virus, Ross River Virus Q, fever, COVID, do trigger this in about 10% of individuals that are exposed to these more severe infections. It turns out that almost any type of infectious diarrhea will trigger irritable bowel in about 10% of individuals, and a bunch of different types of urinary tract infections trigger chronic prostatitis or interstitial cystitis. So we know that this occurs, that these infectious triggers can develop the nociplastic pain. And again, this is a super cool study that was done a long time ago in Australia that actually showed that after three markedly different types of infection, the Epstein Barr Virus, Q, fever and Borreliosis, even though the acute manifestations of those three types of infections are very different, about 10% of people that had each of those three disparate infections developed a post infectious syndrome that looked exactly like chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, and again, all three of those conditions led to the exact same about 10% of individuals this was not associated with clearance of The pathogen, with the acute inflammatory response, psychological factors, the biggest thing that predicted whether someone was going to develop one of these post infectious syndromes is whether they had some of these symptoms of fatigue or sleep or memory problems prior to the infection. And so several of us wrote, four months after the pandemic, the COVID pandemic started. We published this article in pain and said there will be a post infectious long COVID syndrome that will look a lot like post dBV syndrome and post Lyme syndrome and post SARS syndrome. No one paid attention to us, and it's only now that the couple billion dollars that are being spent by the NIH and the US to study long COVID are coming to this conclusion that long COVID Probably is largely, again, one of these syndromes, that is, that we've seen over and over and over, that infections can trigger this so can war. I'm old. I was very involved in looking at the health consequences of the first Gulf War that the United States was involved in. And after that war, it became clear that after every war that the US has ever been involved in, there's a group of veterans that come back with multifocal pain, fatigue, sleep problems and memory problems. We call it something different after every war, after the Civil War in the 1860s in the United States, this was called soldier's heart. It was called shell shock in World War One and World War Two. But again, we know that after every war that a group of veterans will come back with these sort of nosap plastic syndromes, multifocal pain, fatigue, memory problems and sleep disturbance. We just had a big conference at the University of Michigan where we devoted an entire day talking about post war syndromes. And it's becoming increasingly clear it's not just the veterans who fight in these wars, the general civilian populations in countries like Ukraine and Israel and Gaza that are torn by war have very high rates of these fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndromes. And the people that are providing for care in these countries, these are a group of individuals from Ukraine that we invited to this conference. We spent a week with them and help teach them how to take care of these conditions, because, again, they're seeing sort of an epidemic in the general population, as well as in the veterans in Ukraine, because of the fact that this is such a war torn country, cancer researchers have seen the same cluster and column the cancer symptom cluster. But again, I want to present this data to give you a sense from outside the field of pain that this syndrome is very common, and you see it virtually everywhere.\"},\n",
    "    {\"title\": \"Talk 3-4\", \"content\": \"So in the Nature Reviews article, we talk about the mechanisms that are involved in the nociplastic pain and fibromyalgia, there's a fairly stereotypical set of things that you see in functional brain imaging. You see a decrease in facilitator connectivity, a decrease in inhibitory connectivity. It's like the brain is hyperactive, and that some of the normal filtering mechanisms that are responsible for not allowing this information from the periphery to come up, to be brain to the brain to be filled with pain, are deficient or absent in these individuals. But But again, we. See that some of these abnormalities actually, in a recent article that Chelsea Kaplan and our group published, mining the large ABCD study, some of these imaging findings in children that subsequently go on to develop Fibromyalgia like pain are present actually at baseline before the kids develop any symptoms whatsoever, you can sort of image this risk factor or this diathesis. And so this is the the first fMRI study that was done in fibromyalgia, was done by our group and published in 2002 and all this study really did was show that when people with fibromyalgia, when we gave them a low intensity stimulus, they really were experiencing pain, because we could see that areas like the primary and secondary somatosensory cortices were being activated even though we were just giving low intensity stimuli. Our group and others have gone on to show that the two brain regions are either too connected to each other or not connected enough to each other in these nociplastic Pain states, as well as the fact that even the size and the shape of the brain changes in these nociplastic Pain states, we think this is due to neuroplasticity. And by the way, our group thinks that the same kind of neuroplasticity that we see in the brain in chronic pain, is responsible what's being for, what's being called small fiber neuropathy, that it's just, we think it's just functional reorganization the peripheral nervous system, and that it doesn't have anything to do with the pathogenesis of pain. One of the big NIH networks that we were involved in is the map network that was studying the condition that used to be called interstitial cystitis, and is now called bladder pain syndrome. But we brought a large number of individuals with the condition interstitial cystitis into this network, and we did brain imaging and all sorts of other tests in them. But one of the most striking findings in this network was that even though this label was interstitial cystitis, only about 20% of people on a body map only had pain in their bladder region. About 20% of people with interstitial cystitis had more regional pain involving their bladder and their abdomen, but about 60% of people look more like fibromyalgia patients in that they had widespread pain, fatigue, memory problem of sleep disturbance, even though the label that they were carrying was interstitial cystitis. And so we were interested in contrasting the individuals with interstitial cystitis that had pain just in their bladder with the individuals with interstitial cystitis that had pain in their bladder but had widespread pain. And what we found on functional imaging is that the people with interstitial cystitis that only had pain in their bladder looked almost identical to healthy controls and functional MRI, whereas the people with interstitial cystitis that had the widespread pain phenotype, even though what they were being called was interstitial cystitis and functional imaging, they looked almost identical to fibromyalgia patients. So again, we can sort of image this brain that seems to be hyper responsive to painful stimuli, hyper responsive to other type of sensory stimuli. It may be the case that the endogenous opioid system is participating in the pathogenesis of these nociplastic Pain states, and this may be one of the reasons it's it's such a bad idea to use opioids to treat chronic pain. I know those of you in the headache field have been recommending against opioid use forever, just like those of us in the fibromyalgia field have been recommending against opioid use forever, but people don't necessarily listen to us, and they're still widely using opioids. And I'm concerned that opioids don't just not take make pain better, that they actually, in some individuals, giving them an opioid mechanistically, will actually make their pain worse and worse over time, and one of the reasons for that is a study we did where we used pet with Carfentanil, a highly potent opioid and functional MRI at the same time in people with fibromyalgia, and it literally looked as though the endogenous opioid system was releasing too much endorphins and enkephalins, and that over release of endogenous opioids, of endorsements and keflins was leading to opioid induced hyperalgesia. So in this article, we said we think that nociplastic pain might be, in part, endogenous opioid induced hyperalgesia, because we think that the endogenous opioid system may be hyperactive in contributing to this sort of wind up that we see in these individuals. And one of the reasons that I rant about this all the time is These are data from last year showing that in the United States, in 2023 40% of fibromyalgia patients are either getting oxycodone or hydrocodone, strong opioids for which there's absolutely. No evidence that they work. And so again, I give an hour long talks on the problems with opioids. I'm just going to give a five minute rant about this. But the first thing you should understand as someone who's done been involved in litigation and has seen a lot of data and FDA files and things like that, is there's actually not a single study that has lasted for 12 weeks or longer of a pure mu opioid that shows that opioids actually, in a parallel group, randomized control trial, are effective in treating chronic pain, and the only studies that are carried out longer term, for up to a year, are studies of drugs like buprenorphine or to pentadol, which are mixed opioids and really have entirely different profiles than a pure mu opioid like oxycodone or hydrocodone, which are the ones that are being primarily used. The other thing that a lot of providers are not aware of is addiction is not the primary safety issue with opioid use and chronic pain, all cause mortality is the primary safety issue. If someone that has chronic pain is taking an opioid, the risk of them dying of any cause is about double, and that's because they're at higher risk of developing, of dying of a motor traffic accident if they're on opioids, higher risk of suicide, higher risk of MIS there's a tremendous number of things that opioids kill you from that are not addiction, that that a lot of providers and patients are unaware of, this dramatic increase in all cause mortality. And again, there's a very real possibility that opioids make pain worse in a subset of individuals, not just don't make pain better. Two studies I'm going to show you that that scare me, because, again, there are no industry funded trials that show that opioids work. This is a famous study done by Aaron Krebs. It was published about six years ago that showed it in chronic pain patients with back pain that NSAIDs and opioids. The the main finding was that, looking at pain interference, that opioids were no better than non steroidals. But look at the second line here. People didn't pay attention to this. There was actually a statistically significant worsening in pain intensity in the people that were randomized to get opioids at one year, compared to the people that not were randomized to get NSAIDs at one year. And then this is a more recent trial that was done for acute low back pain and neck pain, again, randomizing people to either opioids or NSAIDs, carried out for a year. It wasn't the primary outcome measure, but buried in there, first of all, are the tables that show that the opioid treated patients are worse in every way possible at all points in time. They have higher rates of anxiety, depression, everything, they just look worse in every possible way. And then this graph should be scary to anyone that ever gives a chronic pain patient an opioid again, it's flipped the opposite of what you would hope to see if you thought an opioid was working for chronic pain, and that the people that were treated with an opioid had a higher pain intensity at one year than the people that were treated with NSAIDs. And so I joke about this, but this should be a cortical tattoo that that anyone that's prescribing an opioid for chronic pain. I hope that if that, if nothing else from this talk, that you remember this slide, and this is permanently etched into your brain, that there's a lot of data suggesting that opioids actually make pain worse the longer you use them.\"},\n",
    "    {\"title\": \"Talk 3-5\", \"content\": \"And this is a cool study that was done recently showing that even a condition like knee osteoarthritis, using GWAS and using genetic analyzes, it looks like about half of the pain in osteoarthritis is coming from peripheral factors, and about half of the pain is coming from Central factors. And this prompted me to write an editorial. I was asked to write an editorial in response to this article, chiding is, why doesn't everyone use a body map in every chronic pain patient? Because even in our group, where we do functional brain imaging and all the quantitative sensory testing and all these really cool things, right now, a body map, just getting a body map on a chronic pain patient tells you probably more about what's going to work and what's not going to work in that patient than almost anything. The more widespread their pain is, the more regions of pain they have, the more likely their pain is coming from the central nervous system, and the less likely that peripherally directed treatments are going to work. And again, some studies are actually suggesting that we can sort of image this vulnerability of nociplastic pain vulnerability. This is the study that I was alluding to earlier, that Chelsea was a leader author of that showed that in kids that are healthy and pain free that in the next year do develop multi site pain on brain imaging, they have half of the findings of fibromyalgia while they're asymptomatic at age nine. Pain before they develop any pain. And this is a different study that Irene Tracy was involved in that was published recently, that showed that you could predict the individuals who are going to develop chemotherapy induced neuropathic pain by doing brain imaging. Because you're imaging how the central nervous system is going to respond to that damaged nerve. I don't actually think that a damaged nerve in and of itself is always painful. Most types of neuropathy. About half of the people have painless neuropathy, and about half of the people have painful neuropathy, and our group thinks that that's largely due to how the central nervous system responds to that damaged nerve, not to the damaged nerve per se. So when we go back to the slide, one of the first things we have to realize is that these names down here are, they're all mixed pain states that a third of people with osteoarthritis or autoimmune disorders or cancer pain also have central sensitization, fibromyalgia, nociplastic pain. So and when people have multiple pain mechanisms, you're going to have to use treatments that are based on those pain mechanisms. Again, just because someone carries the label of osteoarthritis doesn't mean that the preferred treatment for this individual might be a drug like duloxetine that is clearly working in the central nervous system. And so these are the new Fibromyalgia criteria. They look at how widespread the pain is. On the left by asking people to check boxes in a body map. They ask about the symptoms, like memory problems, sleep problems and fatigue, and they're scored. This is scored from zero to 31 and we think this is right now the best measure for the degree of nociplastic pain that someone has a body map alone isn't bad. But I think by asking people about fatigue, sleep problems and memory problems, you can predict additional variants. And Fred Wolf is a Fibromyalgia researcher that pointed out that we shouldn't think of fibromyalgia or nociplastic paint, or yes or no, the different people have different degrees of this. And he coined the term Fibromyalgia ness to indicate this, I'm not suggesting you use this term. I'm suggesting you understand the concept that it's better to think of this, that people have differing degrees or different volume control settings, rather than to think of fibromyalgia or nociplastic pain or being yes or no. And to give you an example of how powerful a body map is, imagine that you're not a headache specialist, you're a knee specialist, and someone comes into you with knee pain, and you're thinking about whether you should do surgery or not. Well, if you don't give a body map, and someone comes into you with knee pain, you might think that they're going to respond to knee replacement surgery, but is someone with this body map likely to respond if you inject their knee or do surgery on their knee, the intuitive thing would be no. And I'll show you some data that shows like, really no. And so we actually have used the fibromyalgia measure in the perioperative period, first in knee and hip replacement surgery, and then subsequently in his in women with chronic pelvic pain that we're getting a hysterectomy to control their pain, and we showed that someone's score on the fibromyalgia measure on the day of surgery is highly predictive of how much opioid they're going to need to control their acute pain. The higher their score, the less well that opioids are going to work to control their acute pain. Don't get me started on treating their chronic pain with this as well as the higher the score in the fibromyalgia measure, the less likely that people were going to respond to the surgery. So in these studies, we didn't just collect the fibromyalgia measure. We collected anxiety, depression, catastrophizing, but on the day of surgery, we gave people this Fibromyalgia measure, which can be scored zero to 31 and again, our main hypothesis was that this measure would be predictive of surgery non responsiveness and opioid non responsiveness, and it was dramatically predictive is that each one point increase in the fibromyalgia score people needed nine milligrams more of omes to control their acute pain in the first 24 to 48 hours, each one point Increase in the fibromyalgia score made people less surgery responsive. These phenomena were linear, just like Fred said, there wasn't anything magical where the a score of 13 or higher, and that Fibromyalgia measure is said to be diagnostic of fibromyalgia. But it didn't matter if someone had 13 or higher, or they had 10 or 11 or whatever. Each one point increase in the fibromyalgia score made people less surgery responsive and less opioid responsive. And I'll just show that here is that these are two individuals with different Fibromyalgia scores. On the x axis here on the bottom is the fibromyalgia score. On the y axis is the number of people that had that score. So this study had about 700 people in it that got their knee or their hip replaced. This person here doesn't have fibromyalgia because he doesn't have a Fibromyalgia score of greater than 13. But look at how different these two people were after they had knee replacement surgery. Patient B would need 90 milligrams more. Of omes, of opioid to control his acute pain, and patient B would be five times less likely to have a 50% improvement in his pain if he did go on to have his knee operated on.\"},\n",
    "    {\"title\": \"Talk 3-6\", \"content\": \"And then we exactly replicated those findings in subsequent studies in women getting hysterectomy for chronic pelvic pain. And so why is this all important? Well, this is one of the reasons that the treatments that work for acute pain and work somewhat well for nociceptive pain, like NSAIDs, opioids, these drugs down here don't work at all for this kind of pain. And so the first thing is you have to use different types of drugs, tricyclic drugs, serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors and gabapentinoids are the most effective drugs to treat the spectrum of illness. And then again, instead of giving people opioids where there's some evidence that drugs like low dose naltrexone, where we're actually blocking the endogenous opioid system, might be helpful in treating this, and the drug duloxetine, to give you an example, we at the time that duloxetine was approved for use in chronic low back pain and in chronic musculoskeletal pain in the United States, we didn't know who with low back pain this was going to work in but subsequent studies showed that if you take someone with low back pain and you give them A body map, you can identify the people who are going to be more responsive to duloxetine, the people who have more sites of pain on the body map are going to be more likely to respond to duloxetine. And in this study, people the The study showed that if someone had five or more sites of pain besides the back and even though their diagnosis was low back pain, that these people were 60% more likely to respond to duloxetine than someone that had low back pain but only had a single site of pain in the back and similarly for osteoarthritis, duloxetine is going to work better if someone has multifocal pain, rather than just pain in one region of the body. I suspect this is true for using geloxitine in headache patients, but I don't know of any studies that have actually shown this. But I also I want to emphasize how important the use of non drug therapies are in these pain syndromes, because drugs and procedures are sort of working up at the top here. But when someone has chronic pain, they develop increased stress, they become less active, they sleep poor they gain weight, they develop bad habits, and we have to use non pharmacologic therapies to treat those conditions. When I wrote a review article on fibromyalgia and published it in JAMA 10 years or so ago, these were the non pharmacologic therapies that had a good evidence base. And notice that a lot of the non pharmacologic therapies were in weak evidence. There was only one flavor of cowginative behavioral therapy, and there was only one type of exercise that we thought worked for nociplastic pain. Now look at a 2024, version of this. First of all, you see that all of these things that used to be down here moved up. The evidence base for all these non pharmacologic therapies is increasing dramatically as studies are being done in different pain syndromes of yoga, tai chi, bio feedback, acupuncture, acupressure, the evidence base keeps increasing dramatically, and now we even have five types of cognitive behavioral therapy. We can use classic pain based CBT. We can use brief CBT, empowered. We can do CBT for insomnia, acceptance, Commitment Therapy, emotional awareness therapy. There's a whole potpourri of cognitive behavioral approaches now that and again, different subsets of chronic pain patients are going to probably respond different to different types of therapy. This is a website that our group developed by Dave Williams, that is under a lot of testing in different NIH trials, because we think that websites and apps can be really helpful to get people some of these therapies that we now refer to as integrative therapies, these therapies that we used to be dismissive of and call complementary and alternative therapies, like acupuncture, acupressure, yoga, are now mainstream therapies, and the preferred term for these therapies are things like integrative therapies. I always like showing this slide because in the VA in the DoD medical centers in the United States, these are all the treatments that are theoretically available, all of these integrative therapies now are reimbursed within the VA and DoD systems. This is more of an aspiration to most of us that take care of chronic pain patients. We'd love for our patients to have access to all of these therapies and to have third party payers cover these therapies, but most insurance doesn't cover most of these therapies now, and most patients, and because of that, don't have access to most of these therapies. So really quickly, what is the role of psychological factors in this spectrum of illness? Some people this article implied that all people with conditions like. Fibromyalgia have prominent psychological factors driving their pain. We wrote a editorial pushing back on this and saying that that's way too simplistic, that in a lot of individuals with conditions like fibromyalgia or nociplastic pain, the sleep problems, the fatigue, the memory problems, there's a lot of other ways that you can get to know some plastic pain and focusing inordinately on the psychological comorbidities. And there's also a lot of slides that suggest that the anxiety, the depression and catastrophizing that people with chronic pain develop, it's because of the pain, and if you make the pain better, you will often make those psychological comorbidities better. Another reason we feel this way is that a new onset of fibromyalgia in children, mood disorders like problems with anxiety and depression, were not a risk for developing new Fibromyalgia in children. Sleep Problems were attention or memory problems were being a female was but having negative affect was not associated with the subsequent development of new multi site pain or new fibromyalgia. Small fiber neuropathy. I don't think small fiber neuropathy has been shown to cause hardly anything in the field of chronic pain. I think this is just much ado about nothing. I just gave a talk at the International pain meetings about this, and this was the slide that I think everyone should look at. This is a review article that I had nothing to do with. It was published a couple years ago that shows all the different medical conditions that have been associated with small fiber neuropathy, and notice all of these conditions, most of which are not in any way associated with chronic pain. So people that have only heard about small fiber neuropathy from the advocates of this concept in the pain field don't get shown this slide and don't get shown that small fiber neuropathy has been shown in almost any condition where it's been looked for. It's an incredibly non specific finding that, again, has not yet been shown in any way to cause pain. And then finally, there's some people that are claiming that conditions like fibromyalgia are autoimmune diseases. I have to play whack a mole and debate these individuals as well. Again, there's overwhelming evidence. Rheumatologist, a long time ago, discarded the term fibrositis because we could see that this was really quite different than rheumatoid arthritis or lupus, which are autoimmune diseases, and where the inflammation strikes you in the face that these conditions, the like fibromyalgia, in fact, are not autoimmune diseases. So I'll stop there and take any questions that people might have.\"},\n",
    "    {\"title\": \"Talk 3-7\", \"content\": \"I'm just, let me just start off by asking one question, because in looking at your presentation, there's, from my standpoint, there's not a lot that I certainly I would disagree with, but I mentioned, but you mentioned psycho psychological factors, initially you started talking about those not being predictors of outcome, and I think of trauma and PTSD. And had a couple slides sort of suggesting that, but then you also presented slides with war trauma and so on and so forth, which sort of speaks to PTSD as predictor. And there's certainly a robust literature on trauma being at least somewhat of a predictor of treatment resistant pain syndromes. My concern is there's always folks that would really like to not ask questions of the patient about trauma and history, and that this not be a ticket to avoiding that, because they could focus on other other thoughts. I again, I found some of the data you presented sort of essentially conflicting.So I entirely agree with you, Ron. I think that people should ask about trauma. What I am bothered by is that article that we pushed back on said everyone with fibromyalgia has this, you know, psychological problem, and that you probably know this therapeutically, if you approach someone you know with chronic pain that has anxiety and depression and that is not their primary problem, it's really more depression that's reactive to the fact that they can't live a normal life because of their pain that those individuals are resent you viewing like the psychological factors as their major problem, rather than something that's sort of downstream of having chronic pain and so all I'm really and in that article that we wrote that push back on this, one of the co authors of the article has been involved in a. Out of the really large epidemiologic studies of chronic, widespread pain, slash fibromyalgia, and he could calculate that adverse childhood experiences or ACEs might like in a big population based study account for about 8% of the individuals with conditions like fibromyalgia. So that's the is like, yes, there are. There is a group of people with chronic pain where this is being caused and driven by trauma, but there's also a big group where it's not, and where those people sometimes resent that, you know, putting the psychological thing as the major cause of their pain. And so I'm really just trying to get people to realize there's a continuum. And don't think that every time you see someone with anxiety or depression or catastrophizing or adverse childhood experiences in the background, for that matter, that that's the cause of their nosap plastic pain, because the data suggest it's more complicated than that. Well, you say CBT is a strong as strong evidence, right? And I think that we're trying to still figure out the some of the most exciting cognitive behavioral approaches are things like emotional awareness therapy, which may actually specifically help these people with trauma, because it is more of a trauma based therapy. And some of the early reports of EA T are that you identify people that some of the people that you give this to, like, are cured of their pain, or get 7080, 90% better that you don't see with plain old pain? CBT, so I think these approaches are really exciting, and we're trying to do studies now that say, you know, what are the baseline factors that so you can identify someone where these kind of trauma based cognitive behavioral approaches, you know, may work very well, and you should approach that and give those people this therapy. But again, if I had to put this in just a guess, I'd say probably 20, 30% of chronic pain patients might really benefit from this, these kinds of approaches where the psychological thing is front and center and is causing their pain, and if you treat it as such, they might benefit in the other 60 or 70% it's an important symptom, and it needs to be addressed, but it isn't necessarily pathogenically causing their pain. And the driving thing that if you make that better, you're going to make them better.\"},\n",
    "    {\"title\": \"Talk 3-8\", \"content\": \"Yes, excellent talk. Dan, I would like to ask you, especially because chronic pain, many of the chronic disorders are associated with gender and and sex difference. So what are the evidence from your group or from other groups that biological, neurologically, you have to explain that many of this chronic pain disorders affect the more woman, for example, than men. So we and others have done studies that show that if you do quantitative sensory testing in girls and boys before puberty, they they're not. They are identical. Girls and boys are, they have the same sort of pain processing, and we see this in the ABCD data as well. After girls go through puberty, that's when you see the onset of a lot of these chronic overlapping pain conditions. And that's where you see sort of after adolescence that girls, slash women develop this one and a half to two times increased frequency of almost every chronic pain syndrome in conditions like osteoarthritis. You can look at this really easily, because you can image like what's going on in the knee versus whether someone experiences pain. And going back to what I was showing that slide I showed really early, where I said 30 or 40% of the people in the United States that have that X ray, that's bone on bone, don't have any pain. Those are almost all men, because, again, on average, men are in the central nervous system, are less pain sensitive. The current evidence suggests that it's not female sex hormones that are driving this. It's actually the absence of testosterone that there's a lot of data that suggests that male sex hormones are anti nociceptive, and that that actually may more so, because we have these experiments in nature, we have pregnancy and menopause, where estrogens go super high or go to non existent, and those don't reproducibly cause any change in pain sensitivity and quantitative sensory testing and things like that. So in a lot of evidence, including a study that we're involved in of transgender individuals that are getting gender affirming therapy, people. That are transitioning from female to male by using androgens, or people that are transitioning from male to female by using androgen blockers. This is a experiment that is now being done by a lot of individuals, and we're just super imposing research. But again, a lot of the data is suggesting that the individuals who transition in the direction of males have less pain over time, and the people that transition in the female direction have more pain because they essentially convert hormonally, you know, to the the milieu that will make them more pain sensitive.\"},\n",

    "    {\"title\": \"Talk 4-2\", \"content\": \"Thank you very much for that warm introduction, and it's so nice to meet you all virtually from all across the world, from so many different disciplines. And, you know, perspectives really on on the medical world. I was very excited to be invited to this, since there is the patient perspective, the physician perspective, and it's an interdisciplinary discussion, and ketamine certainly is interdisciplinary as well. So I was tasked with the discussion of the pros and cons, and not to be biased, but I will let you know that I do believe in ketamine, and so that's my first bias before I show you any slide, but I will still be critical of some of the data that does exist, and I will be cognizant of time, and I will make sure to leave time for questions, and I look forward to our vibrant conversation this morning. So with a little bit of introduction, if my slides move, there we go. This is Monte Medical Center. Again, I do wear a few different hats. The most important one is mom and wife. But in addition to that, almost equal to that, is my passion from my vocation. I split my time between working in the perioperative environment, in the regional anesthesia world, covering the Acute Pain Service as well as the other half of my life is spent working with chronic pain patients. And I have a fascination of the acute on chronic pain patient as well, and a love of ketamine. So what are we actually going to be talking about today? I want to be fair, and let me just go up for one moment. I have a special thank you to give to one of my fellows, Dominique Chang, who did help me put together with some of these slides. And I'm very fair about this. I want to give credit where she wears due when she graduates, wherever she will go, she will be a superstar. So today, we're going to talk a little bit about history pharmacology, ketamine in the acute pain world, ketamine in the chronic pain world, and then ketamine for depression and PTSD. Because I think one of the most exciting things about ketamine is it's kind of like salt. You can put it in a lot of different recipes, and it still can be very valuable. And, you know, I think there's been a lot of that other uses. So you know, it's not just one, one peg that goes into a specific hole. It can be a little bit ubiquitous if you know how to use the tool in your hand. So let's talk a little bit about the history of ketamine. What is this medication anyway, and where, how did it even kind of, how do we even start thinking about it? Well, in the 1950s there was a new system that was a new chemical, organic reaction that led to the synthesis of something called PCP. And initially it was planned to be a medical compound, but they kind of noticed that it causes increases in blood pressure and nystagmus, and it did maintain respiration, but then at the same time, there were a lot of severe excitation and for profound psychosis. Hence, when it became a drug of substance abuse, as opposed to an excellent tool for clinical care. But there was something there in the water, and so they found a new compound eventually that had all the positive qualities of PCP, without the major side effects and the severe excitation and the profound psychosis, and that was the one that was eventually called ketamine in 1964 it was used in veterinary medicine first, and it's still used today for veterinary medicine, it was noted to show an excited drunken state in rodents, but kind of a Cate leptoid state in pigeons. And the first human actually received it between 1964 and 1966 and there was a study of over 100 people that was noted and published, and they received these sub anesthetic IV doses, and patients were able to actually report talking about these strange experience of feeling like they were floating and having no arms or legs, and others felt like they were dead. And came back. Well, fast forward to 1970 Kennedy received FDA approval after appropriate clinical trials, and during the Vietnam War, it became actually a widely used anesthetic and wounded victims with hemodynamic instability. And now, if we look at today, it's a modern tool in our toolbox, and has been used in clinical practice for about more than 50 years. In 1985 it was actually. It named an essential medicine by the WHO and actually was thought to be one of the most common anesthetics in the world. You know, recently, due to the opiate crisis, which I'm sure my audience is, is highly aware about, there was a renewed interest in ketamine, both for the acute and chronic pain spheres, and we'll be talking about that as well in terms of more recent guidelines, and even more recently than that, even in the last five years, it was actually proved as a nasal spray for the treatment of new indications, such as resistant depression. It's also been used for other medical disorders such as anxiety and suicidal ideation. So, you know, there's a lot of publicity in this world. This is a sample of an anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation newsletter from June of 2020 it talked about the potential benefits and side effects of ketamine, and also the history of ketamine. It's important to appreciate the fact that you can maintain respiratory drive, minimize cardiovascular depression, attenuate opiate induced hyperalgesia, provided as an adjuvant, acute on chronic pain, choice as an adjuvant, and it actually has anti suicidal and antidepressant properties. On the flip side, you still had to pay attention to some of the negative negatives, such as increased airway secretions and minimizing airway reflux attenuation, it can still be a sympathetic in elevating your heart rate, your blood pressure. Patients who are close to an MI with severe CAD should be used with caution with this medication. And of course, the hallucinations, confusions, vivid dreams and delirium are possible. There are these classic YouTube and Tiktok videos of parents taking pictures of their kids after some kind of surgery on who have received ketamine, where they're a little bit laughing at their kids separate conversation. But you may have seen those kind of videos on the internet, also double vision and blurry vision, and so this was a nice little review piece here, because it was actually discussing some of the benefits to review this established but kind of underappreciated medication, which might be the theme of this talk. That being said, we have to speak with caution, because ketamine gained recent publicity in December of 2023 where it showed that a very famous actor in the social world of the US, Matthew Perry, who had been a character and friends for many years, died as a result of the acute effects of ketamine and subsequent drowning. He was known to have been using this medication for depression and anxiety. And it was noted, though, that outside of the weekly depression dosing, he might have had actually higher levels of ketamine in his system that was found in his post mortem assessment. Sadly, the death was ruled to be an accident. But you know this, this is something where we talk about the discerning eye of ketamine. So let's talk a little bit about the pharmacology of ketamine. Okay, what is this drug that's so powerful it does so many things? Well, there's a few antimers of it. It has RNs. Thank you. Organic Chemistry. The s anti antemer is actually considered about three to four times more potent than its cousin, and has a greater affinity for the PCP binding receptor. The S version has a shorter duration of action and possesses greater neuro protective and analgesic properties than its R component, which might actually potentially make it a more ideal analgesic. But preclinical and clinical analgesic studies comparing the two have thus kind of yielded conflicting data so far in terms of abuse, potential studies comparing the two antimers have also produced mixed results. But for depression, two animal studies did demonstrate more sustained anti depression effects for the R antiandre, but there's no really clinical studies to guide this. Just know that there are two directions that ketamine can take.\"},\n",
    "    {\"title\": \"Talk 4-3\", \"content\": \"It's important to understand the mechanism of action, and this becomes a very important slide later on down the line. So one of the things, before we even look at any slides here, that I talk about with all of my trainees are that Pain Physicians have two roles. We are the electricians of the body, and we are also the chefs. So in terms of electricity, we understand that there are a lot of different receptors that exist in the human body, and so we have to figure out, when we're trying to attack the pain bomb, is it the yellow wire, the blue wire, the green water? What are we trying to actually address in order to cut the bomb so that the pain doesn't go off? Well, the primary mechanism of action when we talk about ketamine has to do with a non competitive antagonism at the PCP binding site of the NMDA receptor in the CNS, particularly in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, where it decreases the frequency of the channel opening and the time spent in the active open state. It's also important to appreciate how with a dose response, the ketamine act. Activating opioid receptors changes over time. So this becomes really important in our discussion, because we talk about sub anesthetic doses, anesthetic doses when we talk about CRPS, you know, people talk about half a milligram per kilogram in the perioperative state, and even when we're talking about the beginnings of treatment for CRPS. But if you go to the VA in the DC area. You know, those patients have been known to have ketamine coma infusions for their post amputation stump pain, and those are extremely high doses. So, you know, it's the opposite of the limbo. Not how low can you go, but sometimes how high can you go. And also an appreciation of the fact that the receptor stimulation will change depending on what is the dose that's being acquired. Also, the analgesic effects are not reversed by Naloxone, which is also a separate interesting concept here, because this might not be the source of the anti nociception. And also, when ketamine and Naloxone, there's there have been recent studies actually talking about ketamine and Naloxone for depression. So when they're trying to figure out how it works for other receptors, the antidepressant qualities of the ketamine are not reversed by Naloxone, which indicates that it's not just the NMDA receptor, but actually, in many discussions, there's a facilitation of on the third section, gabapentin, gabapentinoid type receptors. And so this might be where not only are we using it for analgesia, but where we're really exploring the other part of pain management, the the part of being an electrician of the human body, affecting the brain, affecting depression, anxiety. And so I think there's a lot of room here in the world of neuroscience to help with both analgesia, anxiety and other psychiatric comorbidities. So it's a very exciting drug that can be multi faceted in its usage. There's lots of roots of administration, IV, im, intranasal, topical, oral, rectal. One of the things we'll talk about later on is is, is money, because not everybody has access to ketamine. And I'll, I'll just say that in many of my patients in chronic pain, where I do think ketamine can be useful, sometimes I'll prescribe them a ketamine cream, just because I don't always have access to all of the other forms of ketamine for them in the outpatient setting. So just keep in mind that there's lots of ways to have ketamine administered to a patient. That being said, the bioavailability and distribution certainly vary, as you can see here, in this in this description, from im to I intranasal to PO. And so that's an important appreciation. It's really the active metabolite which has a 30% potency of ketamine. And metabolites are mainly excreted in the urine. So you really want to appreciate what is the root of administration and the distribution, the bioavailability, as you're choosing this medication, and in what form it's going to be given. And the half life is about two and a half hours or so. So again, important for After Effects, patients should not go home alone after this medication. Patients should have a supportive environment if they're going to be using these kind of medications. Okay, I briefly mentioned this before, but we do appreciate the fact that ketamine is a sympathomimetic effects. There's an increase in many of the cardiovascular typical descriptors. What's good is that the respiratory diminuation is quite low in this and so it is considered a good drug, that it can be a drug for difficult airways or for patients who have OSA need to be maintained is part of their anesthetic. It does increase the secretions, though, so it's recommended to give something against the secretions and and also, you will see patients with a very clear dissociative state due to this functional electrophysiological separation of their, of their, of their systems here. So while the eyes may remain open, pupils are dilated. Sometimes they're speaking to you, but sometimes they're not. As the dosage goes up, you know, patients have essentially, quote, unquote, dissociated from their body. And a little factoid is that one of this discovery, the discoverers of ketamine, his wife, actually named that that dissociative state always. Thank your wife. All right, that being said, we said all these interesting things about ketamine and all the things it does. What are the things that we don't like so much about ketamine? Well, it's certainly outside of secretions. Can cause post operative nausea and vomiting. It can cause emergence, delirium, hallucinations. It could cause weird and unpleasant dreams. Can be a little bit painful, and injection especially, and an overdose is associated with loss of consciousness. An overdose would cause respiratory depression and all of the cardiovascular effects and as well as severe psycho mimetic events, including positive and negative signs of schizophrenia. So these are things to just keep in the back of your mind. Of the negative part if we're going to criticize ketamine. Okay, I gave you a little bit of background on ketamine, a little history. We talked a little bit about the mechanics of it. Now let's talk about acute pain medicine. Okay, so in 2018 something relatively revolutionary happened because multiple societies came together and said, We're going to put a consensus statement on ketamine. And so the American Society of regional anesthesia and pain medicine, the American Academy of pain medicine and the ASA, or the American Society of Anesthesiologists, put a discussion on intravenous use of ketamine infusions out there in the world, and this is a PubMed practice guideline in one of the large pain medicine journals, or the regional anesthesia Pain Medicine Journal, as it's known. Speakers are from many that I know. They're wonderful people. They're from their leaders in the field. And so putting together a three society statement like this was considered a very powerful thing. Notice, this is 2018 we've been using this drug for 50 years, so maybe it's about time. But isn't it nice that we at least have somewhere to start from to kind of we have our first recipe book. So this was done in 2018 not so long ago.\"},\n",
    "    {\"title\": \"Talk 4-4\", \"content\": \"So what's the summary of the guidelines. Well, sub anesthetic ketamine infusions should be considered for patients undergoing painful surgeries. This is Grade B recommendation with a moderate level of certainty. So there's some evidence that exists, as well as the consensus of the societies. Ketamine can be considered also for opiate dependent and opiate tolerant patients undergoing surgery, which is a very important topic, which we'll get into shortly, because the evidence is a little limited with case reports and series. You know, when we talk about specifically acute or chronic sickle cell pain, you know, while these patients suffer so much, in fact, Montefiore happens to be a sickle cell center. The grade recommendation is Class C, because we don't have the evidence behind it, and also for patients with sleep apnea, I mentioned it earlier, having may be considered as an adjunct to limit opiates. Again, Grade C recommendation because there's not enough data. Now, please keep in mind not enough data doesn't mean that it doesn't work. It just means that we have to prove it. Still perhaps I'll tell you I'm a strong believer in both of these in my clinical practice, but again, I need to show you the evidence, if I'm going to be fair in this conversation. Okay, remember what I talked about before? Salt can be a little bit or a lot. It affects the recipe. It affects the dosing. It affects what we do, depending on what is the purpose of the ketamine and in what context we're using, just like lidocaine and an epidural, there are changes in dosing suggestions, right? So whether it's an anesthetic induction, dose of bolus, dosing, analgesia, sedation, or treatment resistant depression, these are very clear different dosing. There's also these ketamine clinics that have been set up where people come in for a little short infusion, you know? And they do this a few times in a month or so, so. So there are many ways to use this drug. That being said, the literature does not support infusions above one milligram per kilogram per hour in a setting without intensive monitoring. Okay. So keep that in mind. Unfortunately, Matthew Perry may not have been in that, in that in that range individuals of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics can also affect this, and so you might need to think about dosings either higher or lower I had. I remember when I was a fellow, many moons ago, one of my favorite patients was this Vietnam War veteran who unfortunately had a head and neck cancer and had been exposed to Agent Orange, and he had this tumor that was growing out of his neck, and was on this, these high doses of drugs. It was methadone at the time, but you know, that was his PCA, and no matter how much we gave him, he just was awake. So, you know, we do have to appreciate that there are extremes in all these situations. So these are guidelines, but they don't affect all patients. Adverse effects may also prevent you from getting as high as you want to in many cases. For the chronic pain world, when we're doing this, you might I used to run a continuous versat infusion in order to mitigate with some of the psycho mimetic effects. And we would also be doing serial lft testing to make sure, again, that there were no changes to that. We'll get into that a little bit later on. But again, the dose dependent reactions are limited by what you are trying to achieve, and also the limitations of the side effect profile for each patient. Okay, so what's the evidence to support ketamine infusions as an adjuvant to opioids and other therapies. Well, overall, it was concluded that there is moderate evidence to support sub anesthetic IV doses up to point three five milligrams per kilogram and for infusions up to one milligram per kilogram per hour as an adjuvant to opioids in the perioperative period. So at least we have pretty decent evidence that perioperatively can. I mean, is a good thing, okay? What about contraindications? Well, I kind of alluded to some of them, already very poorly controlled, cardiovascular disease, pregnancy, active psychosis, hepatic dysfunction and elevated intracranial pressure and elevated intraocular pressure. Does any evidence support ivpca for ketamine? Well, evidence is kind of limited in this area as a sole analgesic for acute and perioperative pain, so it's a grade C recommendation, low letter, low level of certainty, but there is moderate evidence to support the benefit of addition of ketamine as an opiate based ivpca For acute and perioperative pain management, Grade B evidence. So there's good literatures to support that. Keep in mind, again, you have to have appropriate staff and monitoring on the on the floors for these kind of patients. So there are other aspects in terms of systems based practice that need to be considered for perioperative management, including ketamine. Okay, we talked a little bit about intranasal and there is some literature, but it's still great to see evidence, at least for patients who have difficult IV access, or children who are going procedures in terms of oral ketamine. If we look at the guidelines from 2018 that the evidence was less robust, but small studies and anecdotal reports suggested it might provide a short term benefit in some individuals with acute pain. And so this was a grade C recommendation, but one of the things I'm proud to tell you, which was just published one week ago, and actually the senior author on this was my old fellow who is now director of pain in Albany, Eric Silverman, they did a recent study in combination with Jefferson, with Eric, combining oral administered ketamine and the post operative opiate use in colorectal surgery. And this was a retrospective cohort, but they were able to show that there were fewer readmissions and that there was a preservation of reduced perioperative opioid use, suggesting an opiate sparing effect. It's not a perfect study. Obviously. There was an insignificant loss of length of stay change. There were no observed increase in ICU admissions, which is great, but I think this is a pretty exciting discussion since the institution's initiation of eras pathways in 2019 after the original studies came out. So here we go. We have more promising data, and this is from one week ago, so this is at recent as it gets Okay, so let's just briefly talk about a few questions. Who are the patients that we can treat Well, patients who are opiate tolerant, patients who are opiate naive, patients who are in the perioperative setting. Where can we treat patients well? Infusions are great, as I mentioned before, but outside of the operating room setting, or, you know, maybe a little bit challenging here, perioperatively, pacu ICU settings may be wonderful locations, but we still have to keep in mind all the potential side effects. So they do need to be an appropriate moderate setting, whatever that is at your institution, and what's the right dose. I think that there, again, depending on what the purposes of the ketamine, there are different dosing. There's not exactly a clear dose related dependent relationship because of also the second memetic effects. But there's things to explore in this area. Okay, as we transition our discussion between acute to chronic pain. We do have to at least make mention of persistent post surgical pain. Ppsp, new, new, new definition, old concept, the people who are acute pain or acute pain people, the people who are chronic pain, people as as classically defined as patients who have pain for more than three months are chronic pain people. What are those middle range people that are a little bit like, it's kind of prolonged, but it's not perfect, and we got to figure out, you know, they have a little bit more pain they're supposed to, and they're still bothering their surgeon after whatever procedure. And obviously this affects breast, this affects knee, this affects, you know, many different pathways. And so there's, there's been a an increase in the exploration of these areas. And this is just a few little samples from the regional anesthesia and Pain Medicine Journal of studies that have been put out there discussing random, prospective observational studies, cross sectional survey analysis, perspective of observational study again. And so I think it's just at least important to appreciate the fact that this is a hot topic and that we are starting to put a little focus on it. So what about post surgical, persistent pain and ketamine? Is there a future? Well, the individual studies are underpowered at this point in time. There is a meta analysis that showed a very small effect. The number needed to treat of 12 at three months and 14 at six months. So we still have to do a little bit better in this area. But you know, it's worth the exploration, and this is part of also where different versions of ketamine, especially intranasal, might continue to be useful for these acute on chronic pain episodes that's been mostly studied in the. Emergency Medicine setting, where it provides benefit briefly, but potent, especially good for procedures, but in terms of this persistent pain that exists for long term use, the jury's still out, and hopefully we'll be exploring that further.\"},\n",
    "    {\"title\": \"Talk 4-5\", \"content\": \"Okay? And I think another thing that's very nice is that this is a global phenomenon, so this is just a sample of a five year study current, currently going on outside of the US. So I think it's important to recognize that we are thinking about this, these kind of studies all over the world. Okay, we talked a little bit about acute pain. We talked a little bit about history of ketamine. Now let's briefly talk about chronic pain. So chronic pain, which is my love. There's also consensus guidelines on chronic pain and ketamine. Again, same three societies. They also put out discussions many of the same authors, as you'll note here, since there are other people who wear these multiple hats of acute to chronic pain, and you know, ketamine IV infusions have been have been in existence for some time. When we think about what we know for sure, I mentioned being part of a CRPS center. So that is one of those areas where there is definite, moderate certainty, of evidence for ketamine infusions, and it's been shown to provide pain relief for up to 12 weeks. We can see here. Here's a sample of somebody with a CRPS syndrome of the foot. And I myself have been able to have the luxury of witnessing these patients from before and after their infusions, and then visiting us in the hospital afterwards. And you know, once you see it, you believe it. So I drink the Kool Aid for chronic pain patients for many other reasons, neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia, cancer pain, ischemic pain, migraine pain, low back pain. Unfortunately, there's still weak or no evidence really to support those uses. But I'm, I'm a personal believer. I just can't present to you that data today based on the 2018 guidelines. Okay, so what's the summary? CRPS is great, and everything else is dot, dot, dot. Well, excluding CRPS, there's no real evidence to support ketamine for intermediate or long term pain relief in those situations, there is low, low certainty evidence supporting oral ketamine as a follow up therapy after ketamine infusions. And there's also oral ketamine can be associated with high abuse potential and should be prescribed cautiously, right? So when we use it with the intranasal ketamine for breakthrough pain, it's it has some moderate evidence there, but it can be used for short term actin. So what do we really do with all of this? It's a little bit confusing, right? So we know it kind of works in the short term. We know it works for CRPS, but everything else, the waters are a little bit mucky at this point in time, even though Dr bersenko is telling you it's great, there are certain pain populations at the same time where ketamine should be considered for infusion therapy, well, for spinal cord injury, there is weak evidence supporting infusion rates ranging from 17 minutes to five hours for seven days, for short term improvements of pain, for CRPS, we talked about it that one, we feel like we can put a grade B checkmark recommendation for mixed neuropathic pain syndromes, like all the ones I mentioned right now, weak or no evidence, at least for immediate improvements of pain, grade D, unfortunately. So excluding CRPS, there's no real evidence supporting all these chronic pain and intermediate, long term improvements of pain. What are we going to do with that? Well, let's also talk about the contrary indications to continue this Debbie downward movement. Well, the contraindications are similar for acute pain and serial ketamine infusion should not be taken in patients who have active a substance abuse problem, and should be used along with universal cautions with regards to abuse, that's grade C evidence. Okay, so, and we've seen people who unfortunately have suffered the sequelae of ketamine. Okay, the other part of ketamine is it's really expensive, well, so this is from 2022 and this is a discussion from the Azra pain societies, and they talk about how expensive it is, so there's no FDA approved real indication for these infusions as a treatment modality, and the data has shown growing evidence that, you know, we don't really know exactly what we're doing here, so maybe we shouldn't pay for it. So I can tell you where I was, in one of my prior institutions, there were a lot of people there who had money, and so because of that, the numbers didn't quite matter so much, and they were able to have these seven day stays and to have these high dose treatments, and that wasn't really an issue. Many of them were lucky to have amazing results. That being said, this is not somebody, this is not a treatment that has equity, because insurance companies are not equal and this, this is not something where all patients can have access to this treatment. And I think that that's one of the things that also limits its exploration at this stage of the game. So is there any evidence for supporting. In therapeutic dose cutoff thresholds, infusion rates or higher doses. Maybe, if we give them a lot more, you know, maybe, maybe that'll make it better. Well, there's is moderate evidence to support higher dosage of ketamine over longer periods of time and more frequent in administration for chronic pain. So great. So if we can just get them the drug, give them more of it and do it more frequently, maybe we're gonna have better data there. There's similar strategies used for opiates and other analgesics with significant adverse effects, though, so it's reasonable to start with a single outpatient infusion and then kind of reassessing treatment. And so that's a great see evidence of great we can kind of titrate it up, but if we don't have access to the drug, and if it doesn't help everyone, there's, there's, there's some, there's some holes in this, in this road that we're trying to travel upon. So is there any role for oral ketamine? Okay, so IV infusions are kind of meh. We're not perfect here. What about oral or other NMDA receptor antagonisms as a follow up for treatment in rule of in lieu of repeat infusions? Well, there's low level support of oral ketamine and other NMDA receptor antagonism as a follow up therapy. There's moderate evidence to talk about intranasal and then also the oral ketamine still has significant abuse potential and street value. So you know, do we really want to be adding this to the waters of what exists in the in the common world, used with caution, and then also considering the cost and resources, it's kind of complicated, so at least we might want to consider these intranasal, oral and other treatments in lieu of serious treatment, at least that one is at least Grade B evidence, because the other stuff is so expensive and complicated to organize that maybe we can at least look at those other routes and begin to explore that more. So I'm encouraging this conversation, even outside of today's Grand Rounds. Okay, so let's just say that we have the ketamine Great. What tests should be ordered prior to an infusion of ketamine? Well, there's insufferative evidence about this as well. So pre infusion testing, we're not really sure what we need to do for the healthy person who's just starting this out, individuals at higher risk of cardiovascular events might might consider, you know, baseline ECG testing, you know, to exclude individuals with uncontrolled ischemic disease that we didn't know about and invasion in patients with baseline liver dysfunction who are alcoholics or people with chronic hepatitis or who are expected to receive very high doses of ketamine at frequent intervals, you know, basic and post infusion liver function tests should be considered, and that's grade C evidence all of this, as I mentioned in my in my clinical practice, we did do those kind of testing, but it's still grade C evidence. What training is prudent for patients who, for personnel, excuse me, who administer boluses and infusions and oversee titrations. Well, you know, ketamine doses, again, they vary, and so it's important to understand and see who these patients are and have appropriate follow up. Patients who are older might have different thresholds, so they might need different monitoring. Higher cutoffs with sub anesthetic doses may also be utilized, and so again, need to be recognized. But the basics of monitoring include hemodynamic and respiratory parameters, and they remain irrespective of the route of administration or dosing. We have to make sure these patients are okay, and of course, with that, we have to make sure there's availability of personnel and equipment for resuscitation at all times, and that is Grade C evidence. So no matter what happens, Grade A evidence is be safe and be prudent. What about what about preemptive medications for administration as rescue drugs. There's limited direct evidence support of the preemptive use of benzodiazepines, and no evidence to support antidepressant, antihistamine and anticholinergic pre medications. This is Grade C evidence. I do think, in my clinical practice, what we've always done is started the ketamine, and then, if needed, started the benzodiazepine, but there are times when they're started simultaneously, especially if they are patients that have had multiple rounds of this. There might be an expected reaction and expected dose dosing of this, and did recipe, but the recommendation preemptively is still grade C. So what constitutes a positive treatment response? Well, if we look at the refractory nature of this disease, a positive outcome was actually considered to be 30% greater or greater relief in conjunction with patient satisfaction. And as we can appreciate, you know, patient satisfaction is very hard in the chronic pain patient. On the flip side, 30% could be like a placebo effect. So what really is that? But you know, this is what the definition is discussed at in terms of duration of benefit, greater than 30 weeks as a single outpatient infusion, and greater than six weeks following an inpatient or series of infusions are considered reasonable delay.\"},\n",
    "    {\"title\": \"Talk 4-6\", \"content\": \"Aniations, similar to multiple guidelines for epidural injections, conservative series of infusions should not be administered by root but rather tailored to the patient response. So patients should not be treated all the same, not one size fits all, but should be, you know, really titrated to the person, and considering the long term risks of ketamine, limiting to no more than six to 12 treatments per year is reasonable, so I think deviations can be made as well many times. We didn't do it that way necessarily, but that's grade C evidence and also still under discussion. Okay, so another thing that kind of gets exciting is all of these different receptors. So both in acute pain and chronic pain, there are lots of prevalence of rates of surgery and acute pain and post traumatic pain. And so I think there's a lot of room for further studies in this area. I want to make sure we have enough time for questions. This is a pain faculty talking about the use of non cancer pain outside of the US, and so again, it's being studied across the world. Reminder that there are many different sample infusion rates, and this is another one from halfway across the world. This is from Dr Cohen, who is not too far from us and recently moved institutions talking about his sample rates. And then I briefly want to touch on depression and make sure we have enough time for questions. I promised myself and promised at my my colleagues, that I would be on time and I will be so. I think this is an exciting subtopic, just to whet your appetite, remember that anybody who has depression, 1/3 of patients with chronic pain have concurrent psychiatric comorbidities such as depression, and so you wonder how much of these pathways overlap each other. There are clinical trials that have talked about ketamine for depression, for prevention of PTSD, the primary effects were thought to be part of the NMDA receptor, but actually may be part of these other glutamate pathways. May be affecting the gabapentinoid pathways, and there's a lot of beginnings of discussions on this topic. And if you're interested, I highly recommend there's a DR Huberman who is from Stanford in California, and he does these wonderful podcast type YouTube videos discussing these topics. He's an excellent speaker. And if you have a fascination in this specific subtype area, I highly recommend him. I don't know him, but I think his videos are great. So you know, what's interesting about ketamine for depression is, again, we're the electricians of the human body. We're playing with the NMDA receptor. We're trying to change that glutamate surge there, mother, there are a number of things that are modulated in the brain, and then there's an increase of gabapentin, GABA B levels. And so isn't it exciting that there can be this cascade of effects that have been noted to have serial surges and might actually be able to affect this state as well for post operative depression, it's been controversial, to be fair, the studies are still not 100% I clearly drink the Kool Aid. But please, let me be fair. In my conversation in 2023 there was a meta analysis of 15 studies that discussed perioperative ketamine, reducing post operative depression, increased risks, such as nausea, vomiting, hallucinations. In a double randomized blind trial, ketamine was given to 210, patients undergoing C section with spinal anesthesia, and the ketamine did not reduce their depression at one, two or four weeks post operatively. And you know, post postpartum depression is something that exists in 2021 ketamine was given to neurosurgery patients undergoing intracranial tumor resection, and this trial did show that ketamine could reveal moderate to severe depression in neurosurgical patients. So you know, we're kind of poking in the waters in this area, but I think there's a lot of room to keep digging. So these are a few references, and then, most importantly, this is my family. And so I leave you with the thoughts of, may you always have a purpose to do better as a person and as a professional, for your vocation, your ethics and your life choices, and this is the reason I do what I do. And with that, thank you very much. I'm on time, gentlemen and ladies, I have five minutes left for question. I'm going to stop sharing my slides.\"},\n",
    "    {\"title\": \"Talk 5-1\", \"content\": \"I'd like to give a brief introduction for our esteemed speaker, Jonathan Jerry, I had the opportunity of reading some of his really great work, and some of our colleagues have read it in a number of across a number of settings. He's the science communicator with the McGill office for science and society dedicated to separating sense from nonsense on his scientific stage. He has a master's degree in molecular biology, and he brings his experience in cancer research, human genetics, rehab research and forensic biology to the work he does for the public. He was a creator, writer and a host of the YouTube show cracked science, which used the late night deep dive format to debunk pseudoscience and denounce bad science. With cardiologist Dr Christopher levos, he co host the award winning medical podcast the body of evidence, which aims to contextualize findings in the realm of health research and answer the public's most pressing questions about the biomedical sciences, while also being rather funny and entertaining, he talks about science every Friday on CTV Montreal news, and is regularly interviewed in both English and French languages. As we all know, the area of pain has been challenged, and this is an area where we need much greater focus on issues of science, as opposed to some of the challenges that occur in our field. So Jonathan, thank you again for doing this. Turn it over to you, and we'll welcome questions at the end.\"},\n",
    "    {\"title\": \"Talk 5-2\", \"content\": \"Thank you very much for the introduction, and thank you again for the invitation. I'm very, very happy to be here this morning. I'll be sharing my There we go. Share my screen. I hope you can all something a little bit different, I guess, for your for your rounds, compared to the usual stuff. As was mentioned, I work at the McGill office for science and society at McGill University in Montreal, Canada. We're fairly unique in that our job is not to do PR for the university. We're not doing research, but we are answering the public's question about science, about what is good science, what is bad science, what is outright fake science. And of course, this pandemic has been has kept us very, very busy. So I want to talk about what, how to debunk this misinformation according to the best scientific evidence that we have right now. And I will begin by giving my little disclosure here. So I've ironically received a speaking fee from my own university to give a version of this talk to a different department through the the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences. So, to begin, is world on fire. And I'm asking this question because you, I'm sure you've seen this. This was from from the very beginning of the pandemic, burning cell towers out of baseless fear they spread the virus. There was this notion among certain members of the community that COVID 19 was not being caused by a virus, but rather was a consequence of 5g telecommunications technology that was being turned on all over the world, and that was that was having harmful effects on the human body. In fact, it got to the point where some of these towers were being burned down. This is from my quote, unquote, neighborhood here. Quebec. So this was not a 5g tower. Unfortunately. I mean, most of them were not even, did not even have 5g technology, but they just, they were telecommunications towers, and some activists decided to set them on fire to protect the rest of the world. You might have seen this tweet from the Food and Drug Administration in your country. So you are not a horse. You're not a cow. Seriously, y'all stop it. So they actually tweeted this out, out of their official account. This was, of course, because of ivermectin, which is an anti parasitic drug which has been adopted by some people as a as a perfect cure and prophylactic against covid 19, even though there's no good evidence behind that, and I will come back to ivermectin later on. During my talk in India, some people were being told to apply cow excrements on their head and on their body as a remedy against covid. 19, there was also a mention of cow urine. This got exported to the United States, where some anti vaxxers were telling their supporters that the new the new cure for covid was urine therapy. So please drink your urine and everything will be okay. In fact, if you go to Wikipedia, there's a whole page just on covid, 19 misinformation. And this is a table of contents, and this, with this screenshot, was actually taken a year ago, so I'm sure it's actually gotten worse since then. So this is how you might be feeling right now. What do I do with all of this? Is the world on fire. There's nothing. Nobody trusts science anymore. Everything is going downhill. So that was the first part of the talk. Actually, it's not as bad as it looks. And you may be wondering, okay, but I want to push back against this stuff, but I don't know how, and there are things that I worry about, so that's what I want to to address here. First of all, a few definitions, which I think will be very useful when we talk about misinformation. It is false information that is not known to be false by the sharer. So for example, if there's an article about the alleged toxicity of a vaccine that is false, it's not accurate, but the person sharing it believes it to be true, they are sharing misinformation, and this is often conflated in the media with disinformation. And disinformation is false information that is known to be false by the person sharing it, who may even have fabricated it. This is also known as a lie. You may remember when the phrase fake news was first coined, it was to describe these websites that were creating out of whole cloth, fake stories about Hillary Clinton, about Donald Trump in order to swing an election, in order to make some money from ad revenue from the traffic that they were getting, or just to have fun. So that is disinformation. And for your information, there's mal information as well, which I will not be talking about today, but this is true information, but that is shared deliberately to cause harm. Classic example is revenge porn. So a sex video is film. It is accurate, but it is then being shared in order to harm the people in it. So that is mal information. The last definition that I want to go over is pseudoscience, which is something that I tackle all the time in the work that I do. So pseudoscience is a collection of related beliefs about the world that are mistakenly regarded as being based on a scientific method, whereas having the status that science, that scientific truths now have it translates into fake science. So it looks like science, but it's not actually science. And unfortunately, there is no clear demarcation between science and pseudoscience. It is more of a spectrum. There are things that are very clearly scientific, there are things that are very clearly pseudo scientific. And there's a gray zone in between where some some interesting notions might be proto scientific. There might be a science in the works. It's not clear. So it's not always easy to figure out if something is a pseudoscience or isn't, because there is no clear line between them. \"},\n",
    "    {\"title\": \"Talk 5-3\", \"content\": \"One thing that is certain is that there is a lot of pseudoscience out there, and I've just placed a few, a few illustrations of that on the screen right now, there's a lot of stuff that somebody who doesn't know much about it may look scientific on its surface. They have scientific studies behind them. They are being sold with this patina of scientific legitimacy around them, but they are not actually scientific. And when it comes to addressing these in the public square and sort of pushing back against this misinformation and the pseudoscience you might be wondering about, for example, the backfire effect. And this came out in 2010 I believe the screenshot is from an earlier version of the manuscript. And this sent a chill down in science communication circles. This was a study done by Brendan Nyhan, Jason Reifler, and as they explained in their abstract, they were providing people with information that was false, and they were then issuing a correction in this experimental setting. And what they. Discovered is that there were some examples of what they called a backfire effect, so corrections actually increased misperceptions among the group in question. So you were trying to address misinformation, and it actually made things worse. The person doubled down and believed in it even more. And so for a while, we were all very depressed and scared because we thought, well, I guess we can't address these issues at all, because otherwise we're just going to make things worse. However, there have been many studies since on this alleged backfire effect that have shown that the original study would be detected was done in a highly specific context, and the backfire effect, if it even exists, is actually quite rare, so it's not something that we particularly need to worry about. Yes, there are people who will double down, but that is not the majority of people. Another issue that you might have in mind is, yes, but you know, if I, if I debunk this misinformation online, for example, if I write about this on Facebook and Twitter, I end up repeating it. And isn't it true that just repeating misinformation will make it appear, will just create this link in people's minds? Right? So if we're talking about the the false link between vaccines and autism, some people write a vaccines cause autism, and then you write, you know, an article saying that vaccines do not cause autism, and there's another headline saying there's no relationship between vaccines and autism, and there's all this noise about vaccines and autism. The idea is that people will remember hearing about vaccines and hearing about autism in close proximity to each other. So maybe there's a link within those two things. I'm not quite sure. I don't quite remember. So that is, it's a genuine concern, and that is why, for example, it's not a good idea to shine a spotlight on a tiny myth that no one has ever heard of, something that could be harmful, but that has gotten no traction whatsoever, because then you're just amplifying this correlation in people's minds that it's actually not true. It's also a good idea. Why? For example, giving a title to a piece that is, for example, is 5g causing COVID 19? Not a good idea. A lot of people just read the headline. They don't read the article. And if they keep seeing these questions being asked in the media about 5g possibly causing COVID 19, they might infer that, indeed, there is a link between 5g and COVID 19. So it is better to title our articles. For example, 5g does not cause COVID 19, and here's why. So this idea spreading concern, this is concern for spreading a link that is false but that will ring true in people's minds. It is important to keep that in mind. But the evidence so far is very far from definitive, and the evidence that we do have suggests that it doesn't often happen. So once again, genuine concern, but not something that we need to, you know, really panic about. There's an interesting model to try and minimize this possibility. There's no good evidence that this model works any better than any other way of going about this. But I just find it interesting, something that you may want to adopt if this is something that you feel strongly about. And this is the sandwich model, which is that, before you address a myth, you flag it as such, right? So it's the bread, you know, condiments and meat, and then the bread again, type of model. So the first, the first layer of bread is okay. What I'm about to tell you is not true, but it's been spreading around the internet, so we need to address this. Then you talk about what this myth is. There's this myth going around that causes COVID 19. Here's why it's not true. And then at the end, you repeat that this was done. This was not true. This was a myth. Do not believe this as a way of, sort of priming the brain to expect something that is not true. Again, not great evidence behind this, but an interesting model to to potentially try and try out, speaking of the literature on good practices when it comes to debunking misinformation, is still emerging. So what that means is that you will find contradictory results. You will find highly contrived situations where researchers bring in undergraduate students, of course, into their lab, and they try to recreate what social media is like using screenshots and what have you. And so it's not quite the same thing as the real world. There's this issue of playing catch up with the internet, which is that by the time a study gets funded and gets underway, they might be testing YouTube, but now all the kids are on Tiktok, right? So there is this, this delay effect because of that, all of that, all of those very important caveats being said. There are themes that do emerge from the literature that can guide us when we want to and have to address misinformation about health and pseudo scientific notions, and it is quite reassuring. So here we go. Very importantly, use facts. Facts often do work. You may think that nobody believes in facts anymore, in a post fact environment that is not. Quite true facts often do work to counteract misinformation, and they especially work if you can provide better explanations, because the brain and pores a vacuum. So for example, I can imagine a situation in which a patient brings up some kind of alternative medical intervention that they've been undertaking, and they said that it worked for them. And you might want to say, well, oh, that thing that you took, yeah, that doesn't work, that that's pure quackery. And then you end the conversation there, and you move on, and the patient thinks, well, but how else to explain that? I got better. So they were not feeling well. They did the thing, and then they felt better. And so they assumed that there's a causal relationship between those two things. And so you can imagine that in their head, they have a table, and you just kicked the leg off of the table, and now the table is unstable, because now they they got better, but they don't have an explanation for how they got better. And if you don't fill that void with a better leg, the brain will go back to its original explanation. So in this particular case, you may want to talk about the placebo response, which is often the answer to this question of, How did alternative medicine work? In this particular case, there are things like self limiting conditions, for example, the flu, if it doesn't kill you, doesn't last forever. Immune system kicks in, and so as you're feeling really bad from the flu, you reach out for whatever you can find, and then you get better. It's not because the thing that you took made you better, but just because it's a self limiting condition, your immune system kicked in. There's a there's the very important process of regression to the mean, which is a statistical artifact, which is that, for example, in the case of chronic pain, which I'm sure you're much more familiar with than I am, there are fluctuations in the severity of the pain, and sometimes there are flare ups. And so you go above the average value of pain intensity, and during one of those flare ups, you know, I can, I can imagine, you, you would want to reach out for anything that you can find out of despair, and then your pain goes back down to its average value, because it basically has to, I mean, unless it's a much worsening condition, you're going to go back to the mean value for statistical regression, reasons of regression, so it will appear as if this intervention work, whereas, in fact, it was just a statistical artifact. And then there's the issue of multiple treatments, which is that if somebody tells you that they got cured of their cancer because of homeopathy, they may not be telling you that they also have chemotherapy and surgery, right? So it's easy to sort of focus on one of the interventions and dismiss the other ones, when they're the ones that actually had had an actual impact.\"},\n",
    "    {\"title\": \"Talk 5-4\", \"content\": \"I'll be referring to a few case studies along the way to illustrate these, these examples, and the first one I want to mention is the one which was flagged to me when I was invited to give this talk, because I've written about Havana syndrome, and it's very interesting, this idea of needing an explanation for a phenomenon and reaching for anything that you can find. So I'm sure many of you are familiar with this, but in case, in case you're not so late, 2016 early. 2017 members of the American embassy in Havana, Cuba, they start to report these debilitating symptoms, strange occurrences. Many describe it as a sort of unidirectional, incapacitating sound, very intense. There's this pressure inside the ear. Some people experience vertigo, nausea. Then we get into sort of the mid range side effects that start to start to happen, difficulty concentrating, memory problems, sleep disturbances. Then we get members of the Canadian embassy in Cuba that are reporting similar occurrences. And then it starts to spread all over the world. And we get these reports from Australia, from China, from all over the world, just outside the White House. So what is causing this? In fact, you may remember your own vice president, Kamala Harris, her trip to Vietnam was delayed because they had heard that there was a possible Havana syndrome case there, and they didn't know what was causing it. And so as so as not to put her at risk, they delayed her flight. So again, the brain abhors a vacuum. It looks for an explanation, and when easy answers were unsatisfying, it turned to more eccentric explanations. So some people brought up the idea of a poison. Could it be that these diplomats were being poisoned through the food that they ate, the air that they breathe? But the problem is that many people in their entourage would also eat the same food and breathe the same air, and they didn't get sick. There was a hypothesis of neurotoxins and the pesticides used to combat Zika all over Cuba, but there were no native Cubans that reported being sick in that way. So it's kind of bizarre that only the American diplomats were targeted in this way, and then they turn into these experimental weapons. Could it be an infrasound weapon? So a sound that is so low in pitch you can't actually hear it, but it would have an effect on the body. The most infamous type of Infrasound is the brown note. This idea that at a certain pitch, when when the body feels it, it provokes involuntary defecation. But the brown note is a myth. It was. It was actually tested on Mythbusters. It doesn't have. In Ultra could it be an ultrasound weapon, a very high pitched sound, but these waves need very close contact to propagate, and they're easily blocked by walls. And so if you're trying to attack an embassy from the outside, you know you have, you have a truck there parked, and you've got your your ultrasound weapon, those ultrasounds are not going to penetrate those walls, and it would also have massive energy needs. So where do you hide the generator that is needed to make this work? Then it was this idea of a microwave weapon. As far as I can tell, these experimental weapons so far, they could be quite unreliable. They're also in need of these imposing generators, and they would also mess with the electronics in the diplomats house, which and they were not affected. But then they brought in the fray effect, which was reported. It's an interesting effect whereby you can hear microwaves. Or you wouldn't think that you could hear microwaves, but in certain circumstances, you can. And so they thought, well, there you go. It was a microwave weapon. They reported hearing a sound. It must be through the fray effect, but the Frey fact requires near silence to perceive it, and the sound was very, very loud. It turns out that somebody managed to record the sounds. It wasn't just happening in somebody's ears. There was an actual sound, and it was identified as being made by crickets, a very specific species of crickets. And they're actually they're very, very loud. So that seems to be what the sound, the mysterious sound, was. And the best explanation that I could find for what happened is mass psychogenic illness. And if you want to dig deeper into this, it's a very good book about this by Robert Baylor, Robert Bartholomew. It's called Havana syndrome, mass psychogenic illness. And the real story behind the embassy mystery and hysteria. And there are many historical examples of these kinds of mass psychogenic illnesses, where these non specific symptoms, they get interpreted in light of some, you know, massive amount of stress that is being felt by, for example, diplomats in a country that doesn't really like them, and that can then spread to other people, who then also start to experience insomnia and vertigo and these episodes of stress, and it turns into something, even though there was nothing really there. Again, we don't really know what is going on with Havana syndrome. I'm not an expert on Havana syndrome, but that seems to be the most plausible explanation that we have at the moment. So going back to how to debunk misinformation, I mentioned that facts are very useful. We shouldn't forget about facts. But sometimes facts are not enough, because sometimes somebody's some belief becomes part of somebody's identity. And so when you attack a particular belief, when you attack a bit of misinformation, when you attack a specific type of pseudoscience, these people feel attacked themselves, and it can be very hard to have productive conversations with people like that who strongly identify with being an anti Vaxxer. For example, there are a few tips that have emerged. One of them is to start with values. Too often these conversations are very antagonistic, and you're being perceived as the enemy, but if you make the other person realize that you actually share the same values when it comes to these things and when it comes to vaccines. For example, I I'm very pro vaccine, but I want vaccines that are safe. I want vaccines that are effective. I want vaccines that are affordable. And same thing with the food supply. I want food that is that is affordable. I want food that is nutritious, that is tasty, and so when you begin by voicing what your values are on this and the align with the values of the person that you're speaking to, all of a sudden you're not speaking across from each other, but you're speaking next to each other. You are on the same side of the aisle, and you're both looking at the evidence, and that can help kind of diffuse the antagonism that can otherwise occur. Another bit of, a little bit of a tip there is to be empathetic, which, which can be hard. And of course, throughout the pandemic, everybody's patience has has gotten very, very down to the wire. But being empathetic can really help and understanding that somebody is very anxious and very stressed about something they believe in that, you know, is inaccurate. I mean, it doesn't change the fact that they are stressed about this, and they have real anxiety over this. And to be empathetic and to voice that empathy can also be conducive to a good a good conversation. It's also important to remember that you may not be able to change somebody's mind on the spot, but you can act as a pebble in their shoe, which means that this conversation that they've had with you might stick with them, and just like a pebble in your shoe, they're going to walk around and it's going to annoy them. It's going to keep they won't be able to flush it out of their out of their brain, and they will keep going back to it. And maybe a few months down the road, they'll be ready for a second conversation, or maybe they'll be ready to have a conversation with somebody else about this topic. So we shouldn't dismiss the importance of having conversations that do not resolve in somebody suddenly changing their mind about an important belief. Sometimes these things take time, but your conversation, if it is empathetic and if it's a good. Conversation can actually act as a pebble in their shoe.\"},\n",
    "    {\"title\": \"Talk 5-5\", \"content\": \"But speaking of what happens when identity takes over, I mentioned ivermectin earlier, and I've written about ivermectin as well. So as I'm sure you know, it's a very useful drug for the treatment of certain infections in humans and animals. Then came COVID 19, and of course, everybody was trying to find any kind of treatment for COVID 19, there are many, many, many molecules that have antiviral activity in the lab, meaning that when you put them in a culture flask, you know, with cells and culture that are infected with a virus, that molecule will prevent the virus from making copies of itself. That's what an antiviral is. But just because something has antiviral properties in vitro doesn't mean that it will actually translate into a proper antiviral that is useful in humans. So there was this in vitro study done in African Green Monkey kidney cells with SARS cov two using high doses of ivermectin, much higher than what is typically given to humans. And it showed promising results in that it was, it was, it had antiviral activity against SARS, COVID, two. Then there were a few studies done in humans. There was a meta analysis of these studies showing a positive effect. But unfortunately, that meta analysis was skewed by one big study, and it looks like that study never happened. And if you're interested in hearing more about this on the podcast, and I co host the body of evidence, I actually interviewed Gideon Meyer, which Katz and Jack Lawrence, who's Jack Lawrence is a student in England who actually first came across evidence of scientific fraud in the ivermectin COVID 19 literature. And that kind of snowballed into an investigation. And there have been many fraudulent studies about using ivermectin, studies that could not have happened as described, studies where you can clearly see entire sections of the data set that's been copied and pasted from one patient to the next. And unfortunately, there's no good evidence right now that ivermectin has a fantastic ability to either cure or to prevent COVID 19. But as you're aware of, ivermectin became politicized, and it started to inform people's sense of identity, and with those people, facts were not enough. You couldn't just say, well, there's no good evidence ivermectin works. These papers look like they're fraudulent. It wasn't working. There was it was being deflected, and they felt personally attacked. And some of those people were anti Big Pharma, and ivermectin is all patent, so pharmaceutical companies can't profit too much from it, and that's something that these people like. And so their reasoning is, well, it must work because they can't profit from it. Some people were very conspiracy minded, which is that, okay, so it works, but pharma doesn't want you to know that it works, because they can't profit too much, so they're hiding the truth from you. So that played into this conspiracy narrative that ivermectin is a great treatment, but they're hiding it from you because they want to profit off of newer drugs that are still unpacked. Then there were the COVID minimizers who didn't like the public health measures and saw no need for them. And ivermectin became a great justification for that. See, you just take this drug that is well known, well tolerated, you take it prophylactically, and you'll be fine. And then you have the non conformists, which is people who don't believe in the scientific consensus on any issue, they think that the consensus is bought for by pharma money, or it's made of idiots, and they like to listen to the truth telling Mavericks, the robes, the fringe views, and those fringe scientists were endorsing ivermectin, therefore they must be onto something, and the scientific consensus is wrong. So this whole ivermectin narrative basically resonated with the identity of a lot of people who had those kinds of values, and in those cases, facts are just not enough. Coming back to how to debunk pseudoscience you want to use trustworthy and independent sources. So some people have a pathological distrust of governments and corporations. I have what I believe to be a healthy distrust of governments and corporations, but for some people, it is pathological. They distrust any consensus that emerges from them. They think that governments are completely paid for by corporations, and corporations are only interested in making money. And so they will keep telling you, follow the money. Follow my see is follow the money. And you'll see that this whole line of reasoning is corrupted. Of course, they never follow the money when it comes to the people that they idolize. But they only they all. They always do it for the people that they disagree with. All that to say that, if possible, it is better to share information. Of course, some sources that do not have a clear agenda. If Pfizer has written a brief saying that, you know, we at Pfizer say that our vaccine is 93% effective against COVID, trust us. They may be right. They may not be lying. But of course, if you're using that as you know, as evidence, a lot of people will look at this very suspicious. Well, of course, Pfizer would say that they want to sell their vaccines. There are sources that do not have this, you know, clear money making agenda, for example, I am tangentially associated with the science up first initiative in Canada, which is a group of independent scientists and physicians and healthcare professionals who get together and who, and we have these campaigns on social media to tell the public specifically about COVID. 19 right now. What do we know about COVID? What do we know about the vaccines? What are some of the misinformation that you might have heard and we're not funded by by pharma, so those kinds of sources of information do not have this clear agenda are better if you're trying to convince somebody, obviously, and also, very interestingly enough, despite what your Facebook feed and watching CNN really do to believe most people do still trust public health agencies and independent scientists, especially in times of crisis. That may be changing a little bit in the United States right now, I'm not sure, but based on the data that we have so far, sometimes the fringe voices are very loud, and it makes it appear as though they are much more popular than they are. But actually, good public health agency information can still change minds. Another thing, which is, you know, something that I've had to learn and and also kind of unlearn is, is don't write academically. So if you are addressing these issues for the public, you want to avoid technical terms unless they are necessary, and you want to explain the technical terms that are necessary. We go to university. We are taught how to write in this very dry, academic, objective, detached kind of way we're using big technical words. But when it comes to talking to the public about these issues, we have to unlearn all of that and right in a way that is much more accessible. It's important to keep in mind that most people have no idea what neurons look like. Most people don't know where DNA is in our body. They've heard of DNA. They know it's it's part of us as our blueprint, but they don't really know where it is. So it's easy for us to fall for the curse of knowledge, which is that you don't realize that what you know is not known by the people you're speaking to. You just assume that, of course, everybody knows about this stuff. You don't even question it. But actually, you kind of have to take a step back and go, Wait a second. Do they do they know this thing that I take for granted? Maybe not, which is why it is important to use analogies and metaphors and other figures of speech as needed. A very helpful tip is to ask yourself, would my grandma understand this unless, of course, she was or is a doctor or a biochemist or something to that regard, but then pick a different relative. But this idea of having a reader in mind, right? Somebody who does not have your university studies, would they be able to understand this? I think the most important tip in science communication circles is always to use storytelling, and this is something we don't do enough of, because misinformation itself often spreads virally because it is tied to a personal story. I had the misfortune of watching this thing called Vax to the people's truth. It pretends to be a documentary about vaccine related adverse events, specifically the vaccine autism, false connection. It's a piece of propaganda and but it's a very convincing piece of propaganda, because this is what it looks like. It is essentially a series of interviews, often with moms with their child, and they almost all follow the same structure, so they talk about how their child was wonderful at first, and there's soft acoustic guitar music in the background, and you see pictures of the baby smiling, and then they got the MMR shot, and they were never the same. And then the mom starts crying. And there's an accumulation of these anecdotes, these testimonials, for an hour and a half. And I can very easily imagine that if I'm a new parent, or if I'm a parent to be and I see this, I'm going to start getting very nervous, because now there's an accumulation of anecdotes, and I'm a little bit scared now, am I? Am I being lied to? Is there something wrong with this thing? And of course, then you enter the anti vaccination infrastructure, which is very, very well funded, and which might scare you away from giving your child very safe and effective childhood immunizations. So the reason that this works is that our brain is wired to respond to stories. We are storytelling species, and we can also use that on our side, because a narrative can be used to convey science in a compelling and memorable way, or also as a hook to guide the audience into the scientific data.\"},\n",
    "    {\"title\": \"Talk 5-6\", \"content\": \"For example, I just previously said, random you, if you, if you ever, if you've ever read a piece in the newspaper about a health, some kind of health story, it almost always starts with an anecdote. And this is a piece I found in The Globe and Mail. And it goes like this, like a lot of people when Toronto Life Coach and Speaker Ryan. Carry is about to give a speech in front of a crowd. She reminds yourself to breathe, and there's a quote, and then we and then we go into breath work. Is there evidence behind breath work or not? So journalists are taught to do do, to do this all the time, because it works. It helps. It helps the reader focus on a person that they can relate to, and you follow their journey, as opposed to just starting with facts and starting with with numbers, which which are a little bit on the dry side. Um, another tip is to point out fallacies and biases responsibly. So pseudoscience often appears believable because of biases in our thinking. So ways in which our thinking is skewed away from the truth away from being reliable in ways that are very predictable. And then there are errors in logic that are known as fallacies, that appear to be logical, but they're not, but they're very convincing. And I'll give you just a handful of examples. When it comes to health related pseudoscience, the most popular ones are the appeal to nature, right? So it's natural, therefore it must be good for us, it must be safe for us. There's a reason why we're spending so much money removing asbestos from our buildings. Asbestos is not safe for us, but there is this very deep wiring in the brain that tells us that if something is natural, it must be beneficial to us and it must be safe in its consumption. And if it is synthetic or artificial, then it's not good for us and it is not safe for us. That is a bias. It's a cognitive bias. It is not true, and it can be weaponized as a logical fallacy. And you see this all over the wellness space. So it can be and can be useful to point this out. Like to give examples of things that are natural, that are not good for us, and things are synthetic, which are perfectly safe for us. You know, the dose makes the poison. We have to test these things to know how safe they are, and other biases. The appeal to antiquity, which is, oh, well, this day, it's been used for 200 years because it works. Otherwise, why would we still be using it? Of course, I don't need to tell you that for centuries, bloodletting and leeches were used in medicine because there was nothing else, and apart from a few very specific applications, now, medicine has moved on. So just because something has been used for a very long time does not actually imply that it is working. And the biggest bias, I think, the most important bias in our brain, is the confirmation bias. And this something that we are all we can all fall for. We have to be aware of this, and it is starting from a conclusion that we like and working backwards. So you start by saying, I believe that this thing works. So now I will go on either on the internet, I will find papers that support my view, and I will dismiss those that disagree with me, and then I will convince myself that I've done my own research, and I've been very objective about this, but you know, it just so happens that my conclusion was proven true. And again, we're all susceptible to this, and this is something that we have to struggle to to, to exert ourselves from emphasize the consensus, if there is one, obviously, when COVID 19 started, there was no consensus, because we didn't know anything about this. New viruses don't come with instructions manuals, but eventually there's enough evidence from different lines of inquiry that converge in the same direction, and you get a consensus. And very often, what happens in pseudoscience is that the mainstream view and the fringe view are put on equal footing. They're given this false balance. And if the public doesn't know that one of them is a consensus and one of them is a fringe view, they will think that there's a genuine uncertainty, there's a genuine debate happening in the scientific community. So sometimes can be very helpful to remind people that, no, no, the weight of the evidence is here. We know this for pretty much for a fact, and that person over there has a very, very fringe view. They're just very, very loud. And that can put things back into perspective on social media. It can be very useful to remind people to slow down. There is evidence that people often share misinformation, not because they want to cause harm. I mean, it's misinformation. They don't know that it's false, simply because their attention is focused on factors other than accuracy, they don't stop to ask themselves, is this true? And so by reminding them to pay attention, to slow down and to ask themselves, if this information is active before sharing, we can reduce the spread of misinformation. You know, it's the social media companies have all these incentives built into their system to get us to react very quickly in anger and disgust and to share. But you have to ask yourself, you know, will somebody die if I don't share this right now, if I take the time, I don't have time now I'm at work. I don't have time to read the article. I will read it tonight, and then I'll figure out if this thing looks legit or not. So nobody's going to die if you don't share that particular tweet. So if we all slow down, we could contribute to slowing down the spread of misinformation and Fauci. Finally, avoid shaming, be empathetic. You know, it's important to remind all of us that ordinary people who fall for misinformation do not deserve scorn. There are people that are generating disinformation and that are profiting mightily from it, and I do believe that these people deserve scorn, but the people who just fall for this, they do not deserve scorn, because when was the last time that you change your mind after being called an idiot? Right? It doesn't. It doesn't really work. I think there's value in and this is especially in one on one conversations in the real world. But there's a lot of a lot to gain from listening to these people first, even when you know what they're about to say, you know that this is misinformation. Listening first is good. It establishes a relationship of trust. It means that you care, and acknowledging the validity of their worries is important as well. I understand that you were stressed out about this. I would be too. You may want to concede the parts that they got right. You know, I understand that you are worried about the pharmaceutical industry and the and the and the influence that it can have on on healthcare professionals. I worry about this as well, and then present active evidence. But despite that, you know here's why, why we know that the covid 19 vaccines are safe and effective. Here are the studies that have been done, but starting by listening, by acknowledging the validity of their worries, conceding the parts of the gut right, and then presenting the evidence. And then you can use your personal experience as an example, if it exists, if it is about discussing childhood vaccinations with with a parent who is hesitant. And you have kids and you have vaccinated them, talking about bad examples, and, you know, I have three kids, and they're fully vaccinated, and nothing wrong you know happened with them. These vaccines have been very, very well tested using that again, that storytelling, personal experience, it can really make a difference that being said, you may be very, very compassionate and still draw the ire of people who feel offended nonetheless. And that brings us to our last case study for today, which is multiple chemical sensitivity. So for those of you who don't know multiple chemical sensitivity, which goes under by different names as well, it is a diagnosis or a syndrome of non specific symptoms that can affect seemingly every organ system in the body. The culprit that is being blamed within this diagnosis is small concentrations of chemicals that the rest of us tolerate. It can be perfumes, can be air fresheners, paint, scented products, etc. And so the question becomes, how are these chemicals causing harm? Are they causing harm? What I found very interesting recently is that the government here in Quebec noticed that there were many more diagnoses of multiple chemical sensitivity than were expected given the size of our population. And so in order, in order to address this the needs of this population, our government tasked our public health agency in Quebec, the inspq, to look deeply into the literature to see what was known about NCS. And so the inspq spent almost a decade looking at this whole literature and then writing a very long report about this. And then I wrote about this for for McGill. And just to give you an idea of how massive this endeavor was, this is an 840 page report started in 2012 an exploratory look into literature, then in depth searches in 2013 of 28 different research databases, plus additional search engines and platforms. Then an additional search in 2019 to see what had been published since. So they analyzed a total of 4028 documents, most of which were peer reviewed scientific papers.\"},\n",
    "    {\"title\": \"Talk 5-7\", \"content\": \"And they looked at the data behind several hypotheses that were brought up to try and explain multiple chemical sensitivity. Is it genetics? Is it neurobiology? Is it the immune system? Is that oxidative homeostasis is disrupted? Is there neuroinflammation? Is there a change in the olfactory system, or is it psychogenic, and what they boil it down to is that the best answer that we have right now is chronic anxiety being a causal factor for MCs. And as they write, you know, the authors of this report rebut the hypothesis that there is a relationship between MCS and the toxicity of chemicals present at normal concentrations. Nonetheless, what is being experienced is the symptoms themselves are very real, and there are real repercussions to that. It is a real health issue, and they say that there should be Centers of Expertise specializing in MCs that should be set up, but that, as far as we can tell right now, this is not being caused by the toxicity of these chemicals at normal concentrations. I wrote about this for our office at McGill. I felt like my piece had a lot of compassion in it. I specifically said nobody's calling these people crazy. That's not what is going on. Despite that, this was picked up by people in the community who have MCs, and I got an avalanche of emails people who were dearly offended by what I had written. I got the accusation that I had based this entire article on a single study, because they didn't understand the difference between a report of 4000 studies and a study. I was accused of showing no compassion for very real symptoms, even though there were multiple sentences there where I showed genuine compassion for these people, I was accused of committing an ethical violation, and that this article should be retracted and I needed to publicly apologize. Somebody told me that they were told that a course of antibiotics had disabled the two toxin removing chromosomes that they had, which is why they had MCs, what they had been told I studied human genetics. I know that this is not true. We don't have chromosomes that are just dedicated to removing toxins from the body, but this is what they had been told, probably by a naturopath. And so it was, it was very, very frustrating to have written, you know, to have this report that comes from a good place of the government wanting to act and do something. This is the answer that the literature gives us. I report on them with a lot of compassion, and despite that, because it's not the conclusion that they were looking for, these people were very angry. So that can still happen. So finally, for your sanity, I want to bring you my most important slide. If you are interested in tackling misinformation and pseudoscience. And this is the slide, the people who are strongly against you, they can hardly be reached. And I don't write for these people, right? I don't think that it's a good investment of time and energy and mental stress to try and reach the people who are very, very very strongly against me. The people who are strongly on my side, they can amplify my voice. They can share what I do my work, with people that I couldn't reach otherwise. But I write for the people in the middle, the people who are undecided, the people who are on the fence, who are confused. They've heard one thing, they've heard the other thing. They don't know what's true, and that is my target audience, so I would strongly invite you to not be this person who is not coming to bed because someone is wrong on the internet, you can't change. You know, you can get rid of irrationality and scientific illiteracy on the entire planet, but you can certainly make a difference with people who are genuinely and understandably confused. So here are some links for you if you want to take a screenshot of this slide before I stop sharing my screen and we go to the Q and A. I put up first here some good resources on debunking and science communication. I mentioned the science of first initiative. There are some podcasts that I recommend, some YouTube channels. Also, you don't have to reinvent the wheel. You can share content that already exists. All the case studies that I mentioned are things that I've written about from McGill. So you can search for these on our website at McGill, dot C, slash, OSS, and if you want to find me in my work, if you want to reach out at me on Twitter or via email, all of that is written there. So again, thank you very much for your attention. I hope that this was useful and educational, and I will be answering questions now.\"},\n",

      "Title: Talk 1-1, Content: No, absolutely. Doc Chapman, Dr Coolidge, everybody else who's currently on this call, thanks for the opportunity to really talk about what is extremely important and fundamental in our space, and it's the concept of shared decision making in what we do in chronic pain and management, but really going into the ethical and public health implications that we face pretty much every day, you can argue. And my hope is that, you know, I'll be able to really define what what shared decision making in pain management actually means, going to some of the bioethical principles of shared decision making in a space, and then hopefully analyze the ethical and public health implications of of shared decision making in a chronic pain space. Now the agenda is going to be as it's going to be pretty straightforward. I'll go through the introduction, go through the pain management aspect, the bioethical principles, public health and really my punchline that I usually call when in doubt. So I think there's a fundamental understanding of how history has panned out when it comes to medical decision making. And what's very interesting is, if you look back to the 1900s all the way down to early 1990s you can see that there's there was a huge gap in really understanding the psychology of that patient physician relationship. But what is obvious is that the trend is migrating towards and empowering patients to ensure that they understand why they, why they they receive the care that they did, that they do. Now, having said that is what exactly are we referring to shared as shared decision making. This idea is that the patient and the physician develops shared goals. They develop informed decision and there is patient engagement where the patient is actively involved in the decision making process about their health and the care that they receive. Now this is important, and the reason why this is important is because when shared decision making is implemented, studies have shown that it promotes patient autonomy, satisfaction and the value and preferences of the patients are recognized early to. In the journey of their care. Not shocking. You can see that there are numerous studies, numerous studies that actually talk about the role of shared decision making as it pertains to patient satisfaction, treatment adherence, reducing inequalities, cost reduction and even improving or minimizing what what has been referred to as the decision conflict process that most of us have probably encountered during our clinic visit. So now, the real summary that I you know, one of the summary that I put out here is just so as an audience, you can extrapolate some of the major findings from from the literature. Is the major benefits of shared decision making is there is improved patient and provider satisfaction, which is pretty straightforward, if applied correctly, there is better enhancements to treatment adherence, healthcare outcomes, such as reduction of pain scores, reduction of blood pressure, reduction especially in The primary care space, outcomes that pertains to chronic diseases, it's been documented to see significant improvement in those in those outcomes. Not surprisingly, when there is shared participation, there is reduction in decisional conflict and and multiple studies have reported better efficiency in running that clinical practice increased cost savings, and, like I mentioned previously, reduction of health inequalities, which we're going to get into in the public health aspect. So now we're going to migrate from this broad framework of shared decision making to looking at the evidence, the definition of the pain space, some of the potential decision considerations we should think about as we really go through this framework of shared decision making in a pain space. So not surprisingly, there are multiple studies that have been put out there regarding shared decision making in the pain space. I put this as a reference for for the audience to go back to, should you, if you want to go through some of the high yield studies, clinical trials, as well as review articles out there? But one of the ones that I that I thought was very pertinent to what we do in the chronic pain space goes back to Lisa's article and Lee and Dr Key's article about really how to think about the concept of that patient provider interaction as it relates to shared decision making. Now in the pain space, it's not any different. It's not any different from what you see in the non pain space. When you think about shared decision making, our patient population could be you could classify as pretty complicated because of the multiple etiology that can explain the pain symptoms that they have from the bio psychosocial to the physiologic changes, mechanical changes, physiological changes. But it's the same concept, right? Regardless of the etiology of the chronic pain state. It's the idea that in the in a pain space, shared decision making is sharing information between provider and patients, expressing candid opinions that is geared towards the patient's clinical outcome, and finally, and more importantly, building a consensus towards a treatment decision that will enhance the patient's outcome during your visit. Now I'm going to go through a few process that that could hopefully create a concept of shared decision making and how it can be applied even further in the pain space. The study I just present that I just displayed by Charles really does a good job going through what this encounter looks like. And from this study, which is very cited in the shared decision making space, it comes down to understanding what this definition of shared means. And like I mentioned, participants include the physician and the patient. The information sharing has to be bi directional. It's not just the physician empowering the patient about their diagnosis. It has to be the physician also receiving from the patient what the true. Understand about the diagnosis, so that bi directionality is very important, and the third component is a concept of consensus, that there is an agreement and and the agreement is more because there is understanding of preferred treatment by the patient, and also an understanding of what the conveyed diagnosis is by the physician, and obviously the final component of this is agreeing to a treatment plan that is going going to be executed., Embedding Dimensions: 768\n",
      "Title: Talk 1-2, Content: When is this appropriate? When is shared decision making appropriate? I think this is a great slide, a great study, because what it helps us do is, you know, really think about, at what level should we be thinking about the shared decision making, what setting? And what was great about this study was they looked at multiple areas where shared decision making processes have been implemented and and what it came down to was the characteristics of the setting where you can most likely see that a very impactful component of shared decision making is settings where there is a short time frame to make a decision, a high impact decision, like going for a surgical intervention that could be life saving, or that could be, that could be, that could result to terminal outcomes if not performed, and and a Decision characteristic setting where there is this preference sensitivity components to the conversation. And it's also found that when there is uncertainty of outcomes in a setting where the clinical practice exists, it tends to yield a very impactful indication for utilizing shared decision making. Now, if you think about the chronic pain space, whether you are a surgeon or a psychologist or a psychiatrist or an interventional pain physician or a dentist who manages pain from multiple etiology, what you recognize is in a practice that is busy, or in a practice where you're encountering so much patient, these actually apply, and I do think because of some of this characteristic, it's very easy to argue the need for shared decision making in our pain space. Now what I wanted to highlight about this slide is the study actually goes through multiple specialties, and it's the idea that the the areas or the setting where you encounter a preference sensitive dialog, A preference sensitive conversation, it is not unusual to to start considering the impact of shared decision making in that encounter, and right here, you can tell the darkest you know, the darkest color just implies that the shared decision making was used more frequently and not surprising. You can see that in oncology and a lot of other settings, such as primary care and mental health. So just that data to present out there. Now, the one thing that I thought was going to be very impactful to in trying to understand this framework is, you know, really understanding what what the evidence is. Now the conceptual framework for shared decision making, you know, this really takes me back to, you know, my public health background is the idea of understanding relationships, right? So when you think about a study and you're trying to figure out the relationship between the exposures and outcomes, you know, you think about direct acyclic graphs. I mean, these are not directed cyclic graphs. But the idea is that a very interesting conceptual framework by crepes, postulates that communication can be can impact patient outcomes and reduce symptoms, improve quality of life, improve physiological measures if you actually create direct engagement between parties and and that's almost like a no brainer, but it's an important framework to think about, because when you when you think about that busy pain practice, it's very hard to implement, because having This direct, impactful conversation without a structural framework could be, could be very tricky. Now, what gets very exciting, though, is the indirect pathway, and it's the idea that if you're actually able to create this direct path, you can indirectly start impacting the patient's secondary outcomes, or or or outcomes that you don't foresee could have been impacted. Acted like the behavioral aspect, the effective cognitive component, and that, by itself, again, creates this framework for understanding how shared decision making can be implemented in our individual practice. Now, I like this saying by a tool, Dr Gawande, and it's the idea that patients come to us, you know, not just because they need some kind of a cure, you know, they want to find meaning and understanding. What this means the most to patients is really the key to to helping them travel through this journey and and I really love this statement, because it truly creates a ground for for taking a step back every time we encounter, especially that challenging case in in our practice. Now, having said that, I'm going to dive into some of the bioethical component of of this conversation, and my hope is to go through some of the ethical consideration as it pertains to shared decision making, and also, again, go back to what a potential conceptual framework could be utilized as we think about the bioethical aspects with shared decision making in our chronic pain population. So for the purpose of this talk, and you know that the ethical part, you could dive in as deep as you can and and there's so many aspects of what we do that can be that have multiple ethical consideration. But for the purpose of this talk, I'm going to focus on these four pillars, the concept of autonomy that we're all aware of, which is respecting the patient's choice and values and decision making. Beneficence, which is promoting well being by managing the pain effectively. Non maleficence, which is avoiding interventions that may cause harm or the do no harm, phrases we were all aware of, and really justice as it comes down to ensuring equitable access to pain management and minimizing inequality. You know, these are the four pillars of the ethical consideration that I will hopefully dive into the next few for the next few slides, and then go step out so we can create a conceptual framework to further understand this better. So before going into some of those bioethical concepts, what is the real challenge here? So the real challenge, and some of you may agree, and I'm sure there's more to this, but the real challenge in a chronic pain space is like any other space, whether it's healthcare or non healthcare, patient satisfaction, or what you can refer to as customer satisfaction in a pain space, patient satisfaction, unfortunately, 79% of patients with chronic pain are dissatisfied with your care, and it's for multiple reasons. We can go into those reasons, but primarily, a lot of these dissatisfaction comes down to miscommunication or some kind of lack of understanding between parties involved, whether it's a physician and a patient, whether it's payers and a patient, whether it's even between patients and family member, there is a huge component of lack of clarity communication and dissatisfaction, and that seems to be a very, very impactful when it comes to dealing with some of the negative outcomes in our space. The other components to what creates a challenge for us on our daily basis, as a concept of using medications that could significantly be either psychoactive, addictive or again, you know, these are neuromodulatory or or or physiologically modulating drugs that can impact not just the pain state, but but other outcomes that that could be that is extremely important. And you know, we've seen this in the context of the opioid crisis that was, you know, observed in the US and now across multiple parts of the world, but, but again, this creates a challenge for us in this space. And the same thing applies to healthcare by itself. You know how sustainable it is, because you and I already know we, we all face the some of the rigors of approval for patients to even get access to the care that they deserve or or clinically justified. And again, creates another challenge for us, because here now we're looking at we're looking at that, the concept that that that when we go into our practice, these are ethical things that we need to really be very mindful of now, Now, having said that, though our ethical obligation remains the same, right so the. Central value of medicine is to ameliorate suffering in patients and chronic pain patients, cancer and non cancer pain are extremely, extremely vulnerable patients, and it's extremely important that the principles of non maleficence, beneficence, justice and and patient autonomy, respect for patient autonomy, be considered in this setting. So So now let's go through a few concepts., Embedding Dimensions: 768\n",
      "Title: Talk 1-3, Content: I really want to highlight this, this book, and I say this because there was in a lot of depth in content written by our own, Dr shatman, and a lot of the framework and understanding we're very, very, very detailed in in this, in this literature, in this book, and highly recommend it. So, having said that, let's talk about patient autonomy. You know, very simple understanding. Sorry, did I was there a question? Okay, so patient autonomy. Now, the concept of patient autonomy is respecting the independent wishes of the patient. Sounds straightforward. Well, not necessarily, right, because what, what the what the patient desires, may not always correlate with what the clinical outcome could be. Could could be resulted to, but it all but, but in the end, the definition is very clear. The patient has the right to refuse or accept treatment, and that's what creates the autonomy. Now, what is a challenge in our pain space, right? If you think about the patient autonomy in our space, you can you can easily tie that to patients or gradually losing control of their care, because just the disease states itself creates such an experience where, you know, there is a negative sequela that comes from just being in chronic pain state, the emotional, behavioral, social, recreational, you know, you name it, financial and also legal. Ramification, you know, it gradually chips away the patient's ability to make decision, and, and, and a lot of you who are seeing patients at multiple spaces, whether it's on the psychological part or treating headaches or back pain, neck pain, or performing surgical procedures. You can tell that a lot of these patients who are in this quantification state or or chronicity, if you want to call it, are losing autonomy every day. And it's and it's important to recognize this, because it creates a layer of challenge in this bioethical framework and not to go into the patient healthcare coverage. Now that raises a question, though, what we think is this really, is this autonomy, or are we? Are we looking into non maleficence, versus maleficence? You know, you could, you could argue multiple components of healthcare coverage, and we're going to dive into it a little bit. So non maleficence, again, the concept of do no harm, it's challenging, right? Because there is this. The concept of do no harm as a clinician is very simple. You understand the application of the therapies you're recommending to the patients, and you're minimizing every possible way of of impacting this patient negatively. However, the patient may not have access to this therapy. And the question of non maleficence, it really goes down to some of the ethical dilemma we see with payers, and I would say with healthcare administrators, right? So a patient needs a therapy, the therapy is not covered because, based on the internal laws, the internal ethos or regulatory policies created by the payers the patient may not necessarily have access to the therapy. Now, does that mean that this is maleficence? Well, the payers may not see it that way, because they they they may create a policy that they think is ethical and moral to their cooperation, and based on that policy, patients could be denied care, you know, but as a clinician, we see the opposite, right? Because we see the clinical indication, we see that there is strong evidence, there is there is clinical trials and studies that have shown that this therapy works, and from our perspective, clearly when that's when it's so clear that the evidence could support good outcome, you can, you can strongly argue that that it's at least maleficence, because maleficence suggests that you know it's wrong doing right you're not. You may not physically harm someone directly, but. It's wrong doing and over time that can, that can potentially result to harm. So again, frameworks, ethical frameworks to think about when you when we think about maleficence in our space. Now, beneficence is pretty straightforward, and it's the idea that you know, you promote well being by controlling the pain effectively and and this is the primary goal of of of that we the primary goal of chronic pain professionals as well as healthcare providers in this space. But again, we run into the same challenges, and you can when you run into a profit model enterprise where emphasis is placed on cost reduction and emphasis is placed on profitability, you really run the risk of providing adequate resources to promote patients well being, and we see similar setting in where you see similar outcomes, where beneficence is compromised because economic models are placed over therapeutic models. So again, you can kind of see the intertwined with beneficence and non maleficence. But it's the same idea that when you reduce the access to resources that patients could have utilized, you can really impact their well being. Now justice again, is that the other component I was going to really talk about, and again, it's the idea that you're ensuring equitable access to patients who are in chronic pain. You know, there's several studies that have been put out there reporting under treatment of vulnerable population, minority population, underserved population. Physicians recognize this as a concern. Historically, the amount of awareness was not as not as high, compared to moving to more recent studies, and that I consider as progress. But again, it's important to understand what can be done or or at least recognize why some of these things are present in our practice. Now, when you look at inequalities in chronic pain management, it is not surprising to see that the studies studies have reported low income education like, you know, having less education certain ethnic or minority group and race as well as gender, are significantly impacted. There's several studies reporting African Americans having having inequalities in outcome, as well as even female patients having inequalities and outcomes and when it comes to the chronic pain states, and not to forget the third party payers, who unfortunately can make decisions internally that can impact who can eventually have access to care, thereby compounding or or increasing the inequalities that we see so So, having said that, you know, I think one of the things that I want to really shift into is the framework. I'm just going to adjust my screen a little bit here in the framework. , Embedding Dimensions: 768\n",
      "Title: Talk 1-4, Content: Now, what are the ethical framework that we should consider, consider when we think about shared decision making in our space. You've, you know, we've all seen what the pillars of bioethics in a pain space could look like. Now, what are the frameworks that we can consider to truly, truly start changing the dialog and and I truly like this article written by dinof at the British Journal of anesthesia, of anesthesia. And it's the idea of taking advantage of understanding Chaldeans framework and codigens framework is really straightforward, and it says that the purpose of of dialog, if it's centered around human flourishing, medical treatment or diagnosis, goals of care, values and benefits, and really understanding the concepts of health that one can actually aspire or, more importantly, achieve a better healthcare outcome in in a pain space and and there, you know, there's several ways to understand this. For from a medical test component, it comes down to how you interact with the patient regarding their imaging. From a human flourishing component, it goes back to how you interact with the patient, about their well being. Goals of care. It goes back to how you interact with the patient regarding what does the patient want? What what is this autonomous to them? Or am I? Am I Am I pushing this decision on the patient values and belief? Very similar concepts of health. Again, very similar. Are you communicating with the patient, whether it's through visual aids, whether it's through AI, whether it's through a structural a mental structure that ensures that the patient is a part of the care. Are you using this five components to achieve that? And and collagen framework suggests that if you can incorporate some of this five framework into your daily practice, you can most likely, or you can at least strive to achieve shared decision making process in the pains in your chronic pain space. So the other component of this, which I thought was very interesting, little bit more complicated, and I put this as a reference, so what? So we can all go back to it if you're interested, to try to try to tease out the ethical decision making process. And this was published by Anna as well as Dr shatman, a journal of pain research, looking at what the conceptual framework should be. I do think what is important to mention is you have to be able to understand what the role is as a healthcare provider and really understand the role of the patient. And the reason why that's critical is because they're interchangeable. Okay? It's almost like running statistics, right? If you understand the association between variables, you're going to be able to predict what the outcomes are. Now it's the understanding of the variable is so important. And what I like about about this presentation, about this concept, is the moral is you, one has to understand the role that they play as a healthcare provider, but more importantly, understand the role of the patient and and the happy medium is when relationship between both roles are established and communication is very clear, you can achieve a Much better, ethical conversation that can result to hopefully better healthcare outcome. So now we're going to go to the public health component of this conversation. And again, my goal would be to really highlight some of the challenges the framework, again, that we can work with, some of the processes that comes with shared decision making and and really understanding what some of the potential barriers could be with shared decision making. So again, a few papers to highlight the public health aspects of what we do in a chronic pain space. I do like the study. I like to review. I do like the review article written by Dr Steve Cohen recently on Lance, said really highlighting what the burden is for the burden of chronic pain, when the society itself, and it goes back to understanding the pathophysiology, the biopsychosocial model, really understanding how the etiology itself is not just a broken femur. You know, it's the it's the it's the social, psychological, a really good article, highly recommended and not not shocking when you talk about public health and pain, it's very difficult to ignore the opioid crisis, as that was one of the biggest public health concern that we had encountered in this space and still continue to encounter, though it's improved significantly and and then I there's another, another good article I recommend is one by males published in British Journal of anesthesia in 2019 really going through what these factors are that that could be associated with the public health related outcomes in the pain space, and I'll dive into that in the next slide and in subsequent slide. Now, the one thing I wanted to just bring up is, you know, the opioid component, because and in a chronic pain space that the opiate pandemic really shook how we thought about caring for patients and and multiple guidelines have been put in place to mitigate some of this public health concern. And the CDC continues to provide, you know, evidence based guidelines to improve communication. And this is important, because with utilizing shared decision making between you and your patient. It could, you can, one can, can. One can attain even better clinical outcome, because you get to discuss limiting initial prescription when necessary, you get to discuss use of alternative methods, such as the injections, the psychological evaluation or treatment, and then, more importantly, discuss the risk and benefits. So again, you're going into the whole concept of addressing some of the major aspect that has resulted to the pandemic, opioid pandemic in the first place. And I thought it was an important slide to communicate. Yeah. Now, when we think about chronic pain and public health, it's a very complex relationship, and I say complex because we very few studies and and I really wasn't convinced with some of the reports in the literature, partly because it's very hard to really study, but we all know it exists. And the public health component of chronic pain is a complex relationship, but it ties back to understanding the key players or variables that that is, whether directly or indirectly, associated with healthcare outcomes and in a pain space, it's not shocking to see that in in in an age group, gender, ethnic group, cultural background, socio economic background, employment status, and how all of those can has actually impacted access to care or or even ability to go back to work. And the other thing that I that I thought was worth mentioning is lifestyle and behavior and clearly the clinical outcomes some patients coming to the clinic with already more severe pain state versus others who have had access with with less severe pain states, thereby even creating a much more complex relationship. Now is that a public health crisis? Is that a public health issue? I do think a lot a lot of research still needs to be done to truly tie that relationship. What is very clear, though, is that there is a relationship between socio economic status and healthcare outcomes. There is very clear relationship between social economic outcomes and as social determinants of health. And clearly, if that relationship can result to an economic burden, one can hypothesize that you can eventually see the association with with public health and chronic pain and again, don't forget the biopsychosocial model as well. So now, having said that, the question now is, we know that there is a relationship between public health and chronic pain. Now, where does shared decision making come into play? I wanted to really go through this article because it the article did a really good job going through how shared decision making could reduce health inequalities, and it cut across all specialties, not necessarily in the pain space. And these authors, what they did was really looked at, they performed a met a systematic review and meta analysis. They utilized shared decision making models. So the study utilized shared decision making models, it was included. And what was very interesting was they looked at the population of the studies, and if the population had at least 50% that were underserved, that the studies were included in this analysis, and what was found, which I'm not going to go into details, is if you look at the forest plot of the study, was that the forest plot was favorable, favorable towards improving healthcare outcomes Among disadvantaged patients if shared decision making process was implemented. So again, these are very encouraging studies to really highlight that there is signals and there are, there's data out there suggesting that we can, we can truly utilize SDM for improving patient outcome. Now, one of the things that I just wanted to highlight in terms of thinking about what this means is, you know, again, going back to shared decision making process, you introduce a decision, the patient understands it, you present the option, you make recommendation, and then it's always important to ensure that the patient understands it. And the final goal is that a consensus is made where the clinician and patient makes a shared decision based on the clinical evidence, the patient's value and patient patient's preference. There are multiple studies that have discussed how this could be accomplished. Visual aids, AI, all have seemed to be impactful in multiple settings., Embedding Dimensions: 768\n",
      "Title: Talk 1-5, Content: I think it's important to remember that there are barriers to shared decision making, time constraint, knowledge gaps, cultural norms, health literacy, that the list goes on and on. But the reason why this is important is because the impact of each of these barriers vary from one setting to another, but it's important to recognize that they exist. Now I go back to this when in doubt slide, and it's really one of the things that I you know, it's hard to accomplish with our busy lives, but, you know, observe it. If you see it, observe it. Ask questions. Is analyze it and communicate it and and the reason why I always go back to this is when you think about the shared decision making space, it's such a young field. It's a very, very young field, especially in chronic pain management. And I do think that there is a lot of work to be done, and there's a potential significant impact that this could have in our space, and with that, I would like to just thank everyone for listening. Patient centered care is why we do what we do. It's truly an honor presenting this talk, and I'm looking forward to taking questions. Thank you., Embedding Dimensions: 768\n",
      "Title: Talk 2-1, Content: Dr scarwani, thank you very much for that kind introduction, and it's a pleasure for me to be here today, in spite of the northeaster that we're having fuel technical difficulties. Just a reminder to everyone, if you're not talking, to make sure that your phone is or your audio is muted. I'm going to start by reminding everyone that the number one predictor of a good surgical outcome is patient selection and in the management of facial pain that we're going to talk about today, with an emphasis on trigeminal neuralgia, that means that getting the proper diagnosis matched to the proper treatment is critical. With that in mind, people of a certain age, you trained at a certain time, will remember this mantra that was drilled into us, that pain is the fifth vital sign, and it took many years for the field as a whole to come to grips with the fact that pain is not the fifth vital sign, and that when a patient comes in whose main complaint is pain, We have the difficulty of depending on a patient's history and description of what they're feeling as the primary means of making a diagnosis, there is no good way to measure pain the way you can measure blood pressure or blood chemistry. Most patients who come in with facial pain will naturally attribute it to an identifiable cause, usually Dental in the case of facial pain, it is very, very rare for someone to come to see me with trigeminal neuralgia who has not been to a dentist. And in fact, it's quite rare for people to come see me who've not had root canals and teeth pulled, and this is no aspersion on the dentists for most of human history, it was not clear that pain in the face, what we would now call teregeminal neuralgia, was really something different than dental Pain. The history of trigeminal just kind of interesting. Dr David Keith pointed out in his talk that the very first article and the very first issue of what is now the New England Journal of Medicine was about trigeminal neuralgia. This has been around for as long as as human beings have been around, but our understanding of it is really only 150 200 years old, and our experience in managing it surgically is even younger than that. So to give a little bit of a review of what Dr Chang mentioned last week, picking out this diagnosis based on history is very difficult to do, and this slide is just intended to give a little bit of an idea of some of the complexity of arriving at a firm diagnosis of trigeminal neuralgia. So on the upper right, we have this very complicated hierarchy of all the different factors that can cause pain referred to the head and face. In case, there's a more focused list of of decision options down here on the lower right, and I find the one on the left here, a particularly useful decision tree differentiating between chronic, continuous pain and episodic pain, episodic unilateral pain, and finally, a way of coming to the diagnosis of probable trigeminal neuralgia., Embedding Dimensions: 768\n",
      "Title: Talk 2-2, Content: Over here,for dentists in particular, there are decision trees that lead to excluding all other causes of dental pain and ending up with this final recommendation, which, which I think is a good one as a take home message, if it's not clearly Dental, the next step should be to order an MRI of the brain and refer the patient appropriately. So again, just for to review a little bit of what we've heard in previous talks here, including last week with Dr Chang, common underlying conditions that can cause facial pain, dental sinuses, tumors in various locations, intracranial causes of facial pain. We're going to talk about a little bit more today. There's something called secondary trigeminal neuralgia, which is caused by a mass such as a tumor or an aneurysm. It's really not ideologically different than then. Then the type of trigeminal neuralgia we consider classic, anything that causes compression of the nerve will cause this, but we kind of separate mass lesions from the classic things that we'll talk about more today. And then there's a problem of referred pain from inside the head in other places. So again, to sum up, the symptoms can be very difficult to tease out and separate from other causes of pain. When we're talking about facial pain and trigeminal neuralgia, and we are dependent on the history of patient, because there's no real, accurate, reliable test to prove this diagnosis. There some have been proposed, but none are in general use, because none are really as reliable as a careful history the two people who historically are responsible for the beginning of our modern understanding of trigeminal neuralgia are these two. You can imagine getting ready to go to work in the morning, and having to do that to your powdered wig and so on, is really pretty amazing. This is Nicola Andre on the left, who is responsible for the name that is commonly used for this disease, titular and on the right, John Fothergill, who Dr Keith talked about a little bit in his lecture, who was a friend of Benjamin Franklin, who really was the first person to ascribe trigeminal neuralgia, and This type of facial pain to the nerves, and understand this as a nerve problem rather than a tooth problem. And that is really where our understanding began with this, leading to that article in the New England Journal that we looked at before and the treatment of patients at that time. I'm having a little bit of trouble here with my pointer. There we go. So how common is this disease? How likely are you to see it in a dental practice or a headache practice? It is actually quite a common problem, and I think it often goes unrecognized for many years as what it is, one of the reasons that many people spend long periods of time getting dental treatment before the realization is reached that this there's that this is what's actually going on. It is more common to women over the age of 40 overall present. The prevalence of this disease is as much as about one in 200 people, and it usually occurs in the lower part of the face. We'll go back in a moment into trigeminal anatomy, but in the upper or lower jaw, again, one of the reasons it is conflated with tooth pain, so a common problem and something that should be high on one's list when dealing with episodic face pain that seems to be resistant to obvious treatments. Just a refresher on the anatomy of the trigeminal nerve. The name three roots refers to the three divisions. So here you see the gasserian ganglion. Now, this is a this is a sensory ganglion. This nerve is very analogous to the dorsal root ganglia, and that the dorsal sensory nerves in the spinal canal, and like those, there are primary sensory neurons here. The anatomy and neurochemistry of this ganglion are very complex. There are many different neurotransmitters here, including things like glutamate, substance, P, C, G. ERP, and it's actually relatively poorly understood exactly what goes on in this ganglion. A number of fibers pass right through it on the way to the brain. But for our purposes, in discussing diagnosis and treatment of pain, it's important to understand that there are three main branches, the first division, which is the which is the ophthalmic branch, second division, maxillary and the third division, which is the mandibular branch. The nerve also has a complex supply to parts of the ear, which you see here, the auricular temple, temporal nerve, auricular, but is the purple area greater auricular nerve. So the upper part here is supplied by trigeminal nerve, but other nerves from the occipital branch of the occipital nerve serve other parts of the ear, and yet other parts are subserved by the vagus nerve. So ear pain is a particularly thorny problem many of these patients with facial pain, complaint of pain that radiates from the ear or is in the ear. And again, it can be difficult for the patients to distinguish exactly where the pain is originating and where it radiates to here. Again, you see the fifth nerve, the trigeminal nerve. It supplies this anterior part of the ear canal and the eardrum, the tympanic membrane here, but other nerves are involved in other places it it's interesting to note that these are mixed nerves, just like nerves in the spinal canal. So even though we generally think of the seventh nerve, facial nerve, as motor and the fifth nerve as sensory. The facial nerve has a small sensory branch and the fifth nerve has a small motor branch, which we'll see again momentarily. Within this area of trigeminal neuralgia, there is sub classification. It gets even more complicated, because classically, we think of trigeminal neuralgia as a sudden electric shock, excruciating pain that shoots down into the the upper or lower jaw, and then when it's gone, it's gone, and people are normal in between that is kind of classic, or also called type one trigeminal neuralgia. That's what we all read about in textbooks, and what we think of when in neurology and neurosurgery is trigeminal neuralgia. But it isn't always that way. It's more complicated than that. There is a second type of trigeminal neuralgia, which has the same apparent origin and etiology, which is a more constant, steady background pain. And patients have mixtures of these two. It's rare to see someone who has purely only the classic type one. So some of these decision trees are based on the idea that you either have one or the other. And if it's just the lancinating electric shock pain, we call that type one. If it's just the background pain, we call that either type two or atypical trigeminal neuralgia. But here's a classification on the left from Kim Burchill, a neurosurgeon at the Oregon Health Sciences University who bases it on predominance. So if it's more than 50% of the lancinating type, he will call that type one, more than 50% constant pain. It's type two. Another very important thing to keep in mind here is that the character of the pain can change over time, and that, especially with medication and treatment, people have a tendency to evolve from the pure, lancinating type pain to more and more of the background, steady pain in between These episodes, some patients will also complain of a subjective feeling of numbness there. So generally, as a as a sort of ballpark overview of this type one is this lancinating electric shock, excruciating pain, and type two is a more dull background pain that's there all the time. They are usually mixed together. This is also important in seeing patients and counseling them, because the electric shock landscaping, the type one symptoms, tend to respond much better to surgery., Embedding Dimensions: 768\n",
      "Title: Talk 2-3, Content: Now we heard a little bit of one more point I wanted to make here is that when pain is in the ear, I mentioned it's complex. One of the reasons I showed the slide about when you go through all the dental causes, send the patient for an MRI, you pick up some weird things on MRI scans that can be helpful. Obviously, if we have a tumor like a meningioma or an aneurysm, pressing. In the nerve those things are important to know about because of their own prognostic implications, but even in looking for the source of pain, here's a patient we saw who complained mainly of ear pain. It did radiate into the face, but it was mainly localized to the ear canal. Little bit unusual for trigeminal neuralgia, what this patient has what you're seeing here. This is left and right. This is the pons the brain stem. And what the arrow is pointing to is a loop of the anterior inferior cerebellar artery that's pressing on the seventh and eighth nerve complex as it goes into the internal auditory canal. This nerve is pressing on the nervous intermedius, which is the sensory branch of the facial nerve. And this is called nervous intermedius neuralgia. So you know, the the imaging is a very helpful thing to do now, before we go on about etiology. So you know, why are we talking about surgery at all? When we had a talk last week about all the different effective means of medical control of this disease, we consider surgery for this in two circumstances, either the medication doesn't work, or, number two, the medication works, but the side effects are intolerable, or both. When patients come in and say, you know, my pain is completely under control, but I just don't like taking pills. I discourage people in that situation from pursuing surgery if they do want to pursue it. I make it very, very clear that the goal is no pain, not no pills. Because what I'm going to go on and show you here is that this is a complex disease, that surgery is very helpful, that it has risks and it is not a perfect solution for everybody at this stage, if someone decides to go on to surgery, we need to understand what the etiology is of this disease to help us design A treatment that works best for each individual patient. So what is the cause of trigeminal neuralgia? We've talked a little bit about things pressing on the nerve. Here's one pressing on another nerve. I'll show you the more classic findings of an MRI of patients with trigeminal neuralgia in a moment. But the answer is, we don't really understand this disease very well. There are a lot of theories. Most of them are just that. They're hypotheses. They're very difficult to prove. It's circumstantial evidence. We don't have a lot of pathological specimens. There are not a lot of controlled trials of different things with this disease, and we, above all, don't have a good animal model of trigeminal neuralgia. There are models that depend on artificially injuring the trigeminal nerve in rabbits, rats and so forth. That's not quite the same thing as trigeminal neuralgia. Looking through the veterinary literature, there is something called trigeminal mediated head shaking, which occurs in horses, but it's it's movement, that it's head shaking, it's not obvious that it's pain, and it's not associated with what I'm showing you here, demyelination. So we don't have a good animal model. And I you know people say, Well, how would you know if the animals in pain? If you see a patient with classic type one trigeminal neuralgia walk into your office, and you can, you can see when they have an attack, these folks will stop speaking in the middle of a sentence and wince when they have an attack, it's, it's something that in an animal you'd be able to see, and there isn't anything comparable. So that hamstrings us a bit in working on solutions to this problem and even in understanding its underlying neurophysiology and neurochemistry. This is a hypothesis as to what's going on most people with classic trigeminal neuralgia appear to have demyelination near the area where the trigeminal nerve joins the brain stem at the root, area where peripheral type Schwann cell myelin gives way to Central oligodendroglio. Myelin seems to be a sensitive area. The idea is basically that this is a short circuit between the large myelinated fibers that subserve light touch and position and the small unmyelinated pain fibers. And that when the myelin is destroyed here, a couple of things happen. You can get direct spread of excitation between the axons here, from one to another, you can get abnormal sprouting and connections between the different types of fibers, and you can even, because of conduction block, because action potentials are blocked in this area, they can kind of reverberate and echo and cause abnormal pain signals. Mean, why is all this relevant? Well, anything that decreases flow of information through this area, that decreases neurological activity in this area, will decrease this abnormal signaling getting into the pain fibers. So what's happening here is things that should normally be sensed as light touch or position or movement are being sensed as pain instead. And if you can decrease the amount of that normal sensory information going up the wrong channel, that will help with the pain. Surgery is focused on solving that problem in a couple of ways, as as well about we're about to look at. So this is an actual pathology specimen from a patient, presumably post mortem with trigeminal neuralgia. The black is myelin. Brain stem is on this side. This is the nerve. And you see this area of extensive demyelination. So this is what this looks like under the microscope. There's also in some people. This is new information. This is a paper from last year by Dr Chris Colley, who's here at Mass General now showing that there are some people who have a predisposition based on certain mutations in GABA channels, both GABA neurotransmitter channels and ion channels, that seem to set them up to be more sensitive to this, and this perhaps explains the reason why we will see people who on MRI scan have things touching their trigeminal nerves, but have no symptoms from it, and also an observation that not most, But many people with trigeminal neuralgia, have other nerve pain syndromes as well. So clearly, there's a couple of things that can set people up. I'm about to show you some of them. And my own experience with this is that in some people, this is a three hit disease, you have a general susceptibility like this. You have the demyelination that I just showed you. And I think in some people, there's a match that sets off the powder keg, and in some cases, that may be the dental work, some initial trigger of the pain. So I don't think that it's always the case that people get root canals because there was a misdiagnosis. I think that happens. But I think in some people that pain from of dental origin may be what sets this all off, particularly if they have the other Double hits of the demyelination from compression and the genetic susceptibility. What else can cause demyelinization? Well, multiple sclerosis is a disease of the myelin, and indeed, in about 2% of multiple sclerosis patients, we have trigeminal neuralgia, often as a presenting symptom. This is an example of that. So it is. It is definitely more common in people with MS. This is a patient I saw recently, and what you're looking at here is an MRI focused on demyelination. These white areas on the MRI are Ms plaques in other parts of the brain, looking up from the feet left and right. Here you see an MS plaque in the pons on the opposite side. And here you see an MS plaque. This is exactly where the trigeminal nerve is joining the pons. And here on this you can see the demyelination, not only in the nerve, but where the nerve enters into the brainstem. Here, this patient had actually had surgery for this, which didn't really work, and came back to me for another procedure. But this can be extremely difficult to treat. Some of these short circuits in patients like this happen centrally after the different nerve fibers have diverged, making it more complicated, and some can have trigeminal neuralgia from far downstream up in the cortex. But again, something to think about because of the relatively high association of trigeminal neuralgia and Ms., Embedding Dimensions: 768\n",
      "Title: Talk 2-4, Content: This is the Schweitzer hypothesis, which I have no idea how to test this, but an interesting observation, getting back to this note that this is a uniquely human disease. Why would that be? There is something else that is unique about anatomy in this part of the body in humans, and that is this basal angle of the skull, related to the fact that we walk upright. So in quadrupedal animals, this is flat, and the nerve would run straight like so in humans, there's a nearly right angle here, and the nerve has to negotiate this right angle. Now, keep in mind that MRI scans are done with patient lying flat, and you can imagine that when they sit up, things change, putting gravity to work here. You can see on the right here, these are primates, so from lemur to monkey to lesser apes to chimps and to humans. You see how this angle changes and. The lower left here. This is an MRI of patient. What you're seeing here, this is the pons. This white is spinal fluid. Black here is bone. This is the actual trigeminal nerve crossing over this space from the brain to the bone. This is the where the ganglion is. And you see how it's kind of suspended here on the asymptomatic side in this patient, it looks unencumbered on the right side, this is the superior cerebellar artery pushing down on the nerve right at that point. So one can speculate that the nerve is under tension, and, for that reason, more susceptible to compression. Here, again, this is my own hypothesis as to why this occurs just in humans. If anyone can think of a good way to test this, please let me know. But interesting to look at. Here's another example of the same thing. Patient that I have actually on the list for surgery at this point, you can kind of see the brain here. This is the trigeminal nerve. The arrows pointing to where that nerve is bowed by the superior cerebellar artery pushing down on it, and this pressure seems to cause demyelination, leading to the other symptoms. So there are really three ways to address this problem with surgery, and they fall into these three categories, corrective surgery designed at fixing the underlying problem. Ablative surgery, which is intentional infliction of some damage on the nerve, to try to block that traffic that's passing through the short circuit. And modulatory to try to modify that traffic in some way to help relieve the pain the historically original one is actually the corrective surgery. And this is one slide kind of giving a brief overview of the history of neurosurgical treatment of trigeminal neuralgia. This is Walter dandy, James Gardner, and this is Peter Janetta. These are three of the the Giants in this field. In the early part of the 20th century, there was the impression that trigeminal neuralgia and other types of facial pain were caused by nerve compression, and that this could be relieved by going in and and relieving that compression, and that was done by an open craniotomy, either in front of the ear, which is where the nerve enters the face through the bone here, where that trigeminal ganglion is located, or from the back of the head, going up to where the nerve exits from the brainstem and heads forward in the course of this, things were often found. The basic idea here was to cut the dura over this to free it up. And I think in some cases, the surgery caused enough damage to the nerve that basically it was the manipulation of the nerve that relieved the pain, rather than the decompression, per se. But the observation was made that sometimes things were pressing on the nerve, and in particular, Walter dandy made a note that he often found a blood vessel up against nerve. He was really looking for small tumors, aneurysms and other things, but he made that remark and didn't really follow up on it. James Gardner, who was chief of neurosurgeon Cleveland Clinic at the time, was the first to focus in on this vascular compression of cranial nerves as a cause, not only of trigeminal neuralgia, but also of Hemi facial spasm. When it was the seventh nerve involved and it was the first to publish on this, Peter genetta sort of made his reputation on this idea of microvascular decompression and microvascular or of blood vessel compression of cranial nerves as the etiology, not just of trigeminal neuralgia and any facial spasm, but even of things like essential hypertension and diabetes. So you know when, when you have the old saying, when you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail. Nonetheless, the disease or the procedure, the procedure, the that we use to correct the vascular compression, is often called the genetta procedure. Dr Janetta trained at UCLA about 12 years before I was there, and his teacher, Robert Rand, was still there when I was training. And if you called this the genetic procedure, in front of Robert Rand, he would just blow a gasket. He didn't invent it. It was Gardner who invented it. And indeed, if you look back, these are two articles in The Journal of neurosurgery. This is James Gardner from 1962 reporting on his experience of microvascular decompression, and in turn, interestingly, going back and quoting Walter dandy. So all three of those people I just showed you are in this slide as the the idea being that blood vessels compressing these nerves and causing. Demyelination, or the underlying etiology of these diseases. And this is Dr Janetta initial paper on this, which gained him that lifelong reputation., Embedding Dimensions: 768\n",
      "Title: Talk 2-5, Content: So this procedure that's being described here, microvascular decompression, falls into that first category that I mentioned, the correct corrective, ablative and modulatory. This is a procedure that's designed to correct the underlying problem. If we think that the demyelination is being caused by compression by a blood vessel, you go in and you move the blood vessel, presumably allowing the nerve to heal and the myelin to regrow. What's interesting to keep in mind looking at the next few slides, though, is that the pain relief from this operation does not require the myelin to regrow, which presumably would take weeks or months. The pain relief occurs right away, and it is not clear why that happens again, having no model, we're not quite sure why pain is relieved immediately. It may be that handling the nerve is enough to cause damage to it and block signals. That's one idea that's called the micro rhizotomy effect idea. Some of my colleagues here disagree with that, and think that it is actually the blood vessel continuing to pulsate against the bare part of the nerve, the demyelinated part of the nerve, that's actually setting off action potentials, and that removing that pulsatility will quiet things down, but again, not Clear doesn't affect how we do the surgery. This is an example that I'm going to show you of an actual patient who came to see me in the office with refractory trigeminal neuralgia and and then ended up coming in on an emergency basis because his pain had simply become impossible to control. So we actually took him to the OR urgently, to do a microvascular decompression, which I'm about to show you in his MRI. Here you can see, this is his trigeminal nerve. This is the superior cerebellar artery from above, and the anterior inferior cerebellar artery from below. And you can see they're coming together on the nerve. You can almost see right there where the nerve is thinned out. And here's a coronal view of the same thing. What I'm going to show you here is the actual surgery that we did. I have about a two and a half minute video here, which we'll see if we can get to work., Embedding Dimensions: 768\n",
      "Title: Talk 2-6, Content: Okay, again, I'm, I'm not sure. Okay, let me stop sharing and go back. Hang on for a moment. So somehow I need to, let's see share screen. I'm going to go to screen two, and there we go. Is that better? Okay, yep, you're okay. Now, okay, so what you're seeing here actually, you can see the motor route of the trigeminal right there. You can see the indentation in the nerve. Here's the artery, the superior cerebellar artery, and and here we are. You can see the artery is much smaller now that spasm from handling the artery. We'll get back to that at the end. This is a ball of Teflon fibers that we've made and pushing into place to keep that artery propped up away from the nerve, as well as away from the brain stem, so it's kind of wedged in the corner where the nerve joins the brainstem and held in place there by pressure from the nerve the artery and this arachnoid over it. You'll see, we're going to just open that arachnoid a little bit more here, and you can see to the left there, the view of the artery still, still up there, the dent in the nerve. Now we're going to go to the other side, the anterior inferior cerebellar artery. On this side, we actually put in two little pledges. That was the first one, second one going in here, and then from manipulation, both of these arteries are in a little bit of spasm. So the final step here, after we kind of irrigate everything out, is we're going to come in with a little Papaver, and which is a medication that will instantly reverse the spasm. And here we come with that squirting the pattern in there. And you can see the nerve now nicely padded on both sides, the arteries been pushed away from it. This patient left the hospital two days later, pain free. So these are very, very interesting looking and gratifying cases when you can do this because you've actually fixed the underlying problem. Sometimes that's not possible. Either it's a patient with MS, or there is no obvious nerve compressing it, or there are other reasons why people are not candidates for craniotomy. There are the people who prefer not to have a craniotomy. And then we turn to ablative strategies, which are designed to impede that traffic flow through the abnormal part of the nerve that can be done at the level of the ganglion, the sensory ganglion with heat, which is a radio frequency rhizotomy, with pressure, which is a balloon compression rhizotomy, or with glycerol injection, or it can be done at level of the root with radio surgery, which is external beams of radiation, a non invasive treatment of these glycerol is almost Never used anymore. It depended on positioning of the patient very heavily, and glycerol getting into the wrong place can be a bad thing. The other three are in active use here. Radio Frequency rhizotomy and balloon compression rhizotomy are both designed to impede traffic through the nerve, but they work through different means. So both of these involve placing a needle through the foramen o valley from the cheek. In the case of radio frequency rhizotomy, we're coagulating part of the nerve, and so we first have to map it with electrical stimulation. Patient needs to be awake to report that they're feeling this in the correct place, and then we use heat to destroy that part of the nerve or partially destroy it. And it's indiscriminate as to the different fiber types that are affected by this pressure works on a physiologic basis. This is again a needle through the foramen o Valley. This is a balloon that's been inflated with a dye so that you can see it when you're in the right place and have the correct shape, it looks like Edward monks the screen, which is very appropriate, I thought. And this works physiologically, this complex diagram here, but basically the pressure has a greater effect on the myelinated than on the unmyelinated fiber. So by damaging the myelinated fibers, you're reducing the source of the aberrant, aberrant signals that are traveling up the pain fibers. That is an outpatient procedure does not the balloon, does not require the patient to be awake, and they can go home the same day. Okay, both of those are highly effective. We'll get back to efficacy at the end. The third one that I mentioned is radio surgery. This is a non invasive treatment originated using the gamma knife, but cyber knife, or linear accelerator, these all work, and they basically cause inflammation in the root of the nerve. They all take weeks, two months to see the full effect. Presumably, there is some change that accompanies this inflammation, which, as it heals over time, is kind of like putting a patch on that short circuit in the nerve. And you see some of our results that we've had here, which are similar to results using radiosurgery and other centers. Finally, there's neuromodulation. This is the idea that you could use electrical stimulation to block the pain in the nerve, and this is the area that I think is most attractive in some ways, because it's less invasive than a craniotomy and less destructive than a rhizotomy. And it is not a new idea, as you see here. The idea is about 2000 years old. I have a little video of this but, but I don't need to play that just for time. I'll just move on here. But this, this is a Pacific Electric ray that that I shot a little video of off the coast of Catalina a few years back. You probably wouldn't want to go around with this on your face, but it's been well known for a long time that that electrical shots and stimulation can block pain. Now it's not again that this is a new idea. So here, here's a summary from 2007 of attempts to use electrical stimulation to modulate pain using the leads at the peripheral branches, at the ganglion or at the root. None of this has reached general use. There are people who use multiple stimulators of peripheral branches. It's a lot of hardware. It has limited efficacy, and so is not commonly used. There's even at one time, as shown in this paper from 1995 from Ron Young. By the way, if you notice how many of these papers written by single authors, you know, it's amazing. You never these days author lists are longer than the abstracts. It's quite interesting to see the number of single author papers that used to exist. But in 1995 this was a system developed by Medtronic called Quinta trigeminal. The idea was to put this lead into the root through the foramen ovale, so as to go through the foramen ovale into the root of the nerve. To use electrical stimulation, it was about 50% effective. It helped about half of the patients to relieve about half of their pain, and in return for that, they had a permanent wire implanted in a pacemaker. The technology was fairly primitive at that time, a single electrode, so it had limited programmability. Well, these days we have all kinds of newer devices that we can put in. This is an epidural cortical stimulator. These are deep brain stimulators. This is something called stim wave. It's a device that uses induction to pick up its power from an external source. So there's lots of this. None of this has been applied to facial pain, and in particular, we've concentrated today, I'm talking about trigeminal neuralgia. But neuropathic pain is also something that we see commonly, for which none of the things that I've shown you for trigeminal knowledge work particularly well. And one would expect that something that can cause that can do stimulation the nerve root would work better. And in fact, you know, our modern DBS technology was developed based on this idea. In other words, we would, in the old days, when we did deep brain simulation for Parkinson's or tremor, we would stimulate through the electrodes, confirm that we had a good effect, and then burn a hole. There. We've moved on from that to not burning holes anymore. Now we have permanently implantable stimulators, but in the case of facial pain, we're still burning holes. And it would be very interesting to be able to apply this modern technology to this. And I'll just tell you that I've been a bit frustrated that none of the companies produce these things are interested in touching this area for reasons that are not entirely clear, but I think this is an active area for development and future research. So finally, outcomes, how well does this work? The things that I've showed you, the corrective and the ablative, all are fairly effective. For MVD, there's 70 to 80% long term complete pain relief. That one out of three patients will have recurrence, generally after many years. Why that is is not entirely clear. Things shift around. New vessels come to compress the nerve. Doesn't seem to be that. TEF. On ball, moving out of the way, but you know, again, this is about the best you can get, and this is considered the gold standard. It's non destructive, and it has a fairly good efficacy for a long term rhizotomy is very effective at short term relief, but it comes at the cost of numbness, and it comes at the cost of the fact that peripheral nerves heal, so that the pain tends to come back after a few years. Now, you can repeat this any number of times you want, but the sensory loss increases with each repetition. And finally, you can end up with something that akin to phantom limb pain called anesthesia Dolorosa, where people have both numbness and pain, so you use this sparingly and as needed. Finally, the radio surgery also works slightly less well than rhizotomy. It's a great choice for people who don't want invasive procedures done., Embedding Dimensions: 768\n",
      "Title: Talk 2-7, Content: And it also, like other forms of risottomy tends to occur. In this case, you're limited to two treatments because of the amount of radiation that you're allowed for a lifetime. And the final thing to note is that starting with one of these does not commit you to that as your only treatment. For example, if you were to use radiosurgery and later, the patient decides to come back for an MVD, it does not appear to affect the efficacy of the MVD, so it's good thing for patients to know. And finally, I'm going to come back to this point that I made at the beginning. The pain is not the fifth vital sign. It's a complex phenomenon. It has no susceptive aspects. It has affective aspects. In fact, deep brain simulation for pain has been shown to work best on the affective aspects. And for this reason, all of the surgery needs to be put into the context of the whole patient. These folks are at increased risk of depression, anxiety, sleep disorders, and if you can't treat these, you're not giving effective treatment to the patient. So for that reason, you know, we prefer to treat this as a team approach, of which surgery is one component. I've given you sort of a quick introduction to how we apply surgery, mainly to try Gemma Morales and facial pain. I think it's a good option for patients who are carefully selected. Again, the goal is control of pain and and again, very important to consider the context of the pain is occurring in and manage expectations with that. I'm going to wrap up for now and leave some time for questions. , Embedding Dimensions: 768\n",
      "Title: Talk 2-8, Content: Yep. So the first question I see here is an MSD, myelination level, CNS, or both central and peripheral. It seems the answer to that is, it seems that it's demyelination right at that entry zone that causes this. Now presumably there are parts farther downstream, so if you have demyelination in the pain nucle And the thalamus, or even the cortex, in theory, that can cause it. But as I showed you in that one slide, most commonly it's demyelination right at that entry zone where there's this, there's something special about the transition area between Schwann cells and oligodendrome. It seems to make it more sensitive to this. So in general, when patients present with tn type symptoms, it's either right there or immediately inside in this in the central tract of the of the trigeminal nerve. So in that close area, the second question is asking about in patients with type one or two trigeminal neuralgia, can blame an event such as dental treatment for the start of their symptoms? Legally, there seems concept breaking the glass and patient develops Tn is a glass ready to be broken, the collision performance procedure that triggers tn can be held liable for the result. Well, you know, I'm not a legal scholar, and this is a general part of human psychology that Ron you may be able to comment, but you know, we have people who have benign tumors of the spinal cord who will say that they're absolutely convinced that this happened because they fell playing baseball. I mean, it's a natural thing for people to want to ascribe a problem to a particular thing that happened to them. And there just isn't any support for this. Nor is there any way for a dentist to predict that something he does is going to set off something like this. So, you know, again, I'm trying to avoid being a expert witness for things like this, but I don't think that that someone trying to sue a dentist for causing trigeminal neuralgia would get very far with it. If you have someone experienced with trigeminal neuralgia can say that's what it is. I mean, I'm speculating that in some people. Of this seems to be a trigger that can set it off. But again, you know, some of this is, is kind of unproven impression from from seeing lots of patients like this, I wouldn't be terribly worried about this. The next question, any estimate on how much the brain moves inside the skull? Very interesting question, you know, again, it's hard to measure that without putting a hole in. Once you put a hole in, air gets in. Things definitely do move, and I have mapped that it can beat by a couple of millimeters. Dr Janetta, who I introduced before, would teach you that if you as a surgeon, go in there and don't find a blood vessel pressing on the nerve, it's because you haven't looked hard enough. And he was quite serious about that. And he was also serious about the fact that when you go in there at surgery, the patient's lying flat, you're draining spinal fluid, that the position of the patient affects this, not just gravity, but you know, we're looking we're used to look at MRI scans as though we're looking at the patient's face, but in reality, that's the way we display the MRI scan. Is not the way the position the patient is positioned during the scan. Furthermore, when you move your head around, these structures are moving. The spinal cord is twisting and moving as your head turns on the spinal column, the vessels there, which are attached down below to the first cervical vertebrae are moving to some extent. So these anatomic relationships change, not just with gravity, but with movement. You know exactly how much would be difficult to measure, but based on the movement of spinal fluid down into the fecal sac when people stand up, I would guess that it probably is, is a few millimeters on the order of two to three millimeters. Finally, when a patient presents a bilateral tn symptoms, do we suspect ms or different, different diagnosis, bilateral ms or bilateral trigeminal neuralgia? Immediately raises suspicion that this is not trigeminal neuralgia, and if you remember back to some of those early slides on differential bilateral pain was one of the things that sent you down another path of that decision tree. So it's possible, it's actually very common for us to see people with trigeminal neuralgia who have vascular compression on their MRI scan that's on both sides, but only have symptoms on one for reasons that aren't clear. I think you always have to rule out Ms, and I have seen people who clearly have both things, who have vascular compression and MS, where it is the vascular compression that's the cause of trigeminal neuralgia. When you have two fairly common situations, you can get that. So I think that bilateral pain would steer you away from this being tn at all, but I think it's necessary to rule these things out. And again, getting an MRI scan is worth, you know, a room full of neurologists, and I mentioned that it's not as successful for type two. That's true for type two, i The number one thing is managing patient expectations. So if someone comes in and their pain is predominantly this constant background pain, I will immediately tell them that that is less likely to respond, not zero, but that it's less likely to respond than the classic symptoms that being said, I would still offer any of these three. There are not clear data that show that one is better than or that one of these three approaches, the corrective, ablative or modulator, that that that one of them is better than the other, so that any of the surgical approaches work more or less well for that type when I expect the outcome to be not as good, though, I prefer not to jump right to the most invasive treatment. In other words, you have to balance risk and benefit. If you expect your benefit to be less, you want your risk to be less also. So in general, for people like this, I'll have a discussion about it, and I would steer more towards a rhizotomy as a good balance between efficacy and risk. Let's see. And there's a question with post MVD recurrence, would you go back in and do MVD again? Well, it's always a consideration. I've done many repeat mvds. You know, it's always easy to criticize what other people do. I've often gone in and found that things have shifted around, that there's a vessel there that wasn't found. The first time I had one patient ran back in the the Teflon fluff was not there at all. It had presumably fallen out and gone someplace. So MVD is definitely consideration again, if Dr Janetta were here that he would tell you that you missed something. Go back and do it again. So absolutely, but these things work in any order that you. Do them. And so many patients are reluctant to have another MVD. And those patients I would offer either of the others, either a radio surgery procedure or a rhizotomy., Embedding Dimensions: 768\n",
      "Title: Talk 2-9, Content: We have other questions. One other question that came in from the chat that I'll read, Is there a correlation between time from onset of trigeminal neuralgia to surgical intervention and outcome? That's an excellent question. The answer really seems to be no. You know, I've had people with pain for many, many years that either went undiagnosed or they were reluctant to have it treated and and the answer is no. Why? That is may relate to, you know, our poor understanding of the etiology here, as I mentioned, when you do an MVD, if this is really caused by demyelination, you would not expect it to immediately be myelinated again. And so when people get pain relief, it's from something else. It's either from handling the nerve and blocking the pain impulses coming through, which is not going to depend on how long it's been going on, or it is, as some people theorize, that the nerve or the vessel pulsating on that bare, unmyelinated nerve, is actually setting off action potentials, so there's not a clear correlation with duration of symptoms prior to the surgery. What does get damaged is the patient's psychosocial situation, and so people have been living with pain for years and years develop compensatory mechanisms in their lives that may be difficult to reverse. I think there is such a thing is too soon. I think that someone comes in with trigeminal neuralgia that started six weeks ago and has not had a fair trial of medication, that's too early go to surgery, but there's no upper limit on that, and I don't counsel patients who've had this for 10 years that they should not have surgery or that it's going to make a difference in their outcome. , Embedding Dimensions: 768\n",
      "Title: Talk 3-1, Content: Now, let me, I'll let you put up your slides, Dr Clow, and I'm gonna, just for my sake, pull up the introduction here as Dr Clow is pulling up his slides. Dr Daniel Clow is a professor of anesthesiology, medicine, rheumatology and Psychiatry at the University of Michigan. He began his academic career at Georgetown University after attending undergraduate and medical school at the University of Michigan. He was a faculty member at Georgetown from 1992 2002 serving as chief of division of rheumatology and Vice Chair of Medicine. Well at Georgetown, he founded the chronic pain and fatigue Research Center, and in 2002 was recruited to bring this group to the University of Michigan, where the group has become one of the most successful pain research groups in the world. He's also served as the first PI of the University of Michigan Clinical and Translational Sciences Award, as well as the first Associate Dean for clinical and translational research, and founded the Institute that houses the University of Michigan, CTSA and the Michigan Institute for Clinical and Health Research. He needs over 450 peer reviewed publications, over 100 million in federal funding, and CPF RC was recently awarded the NIH heal interdisciplinary team science award. He's been a very active mentor for multiple scientists and clinicians, serving as the primary mentor of 35 NIH K awards, nearly all of whom have gone to obtain RC. Or his funding, or the equivalent. It's really a delight to have him here. I followed his work for a number of years, dating us. He had been speaking and speak spoken with us at the request of a Tim the support group at the ether dome, many years ago. And we're delighted to have him back, and we'll be interested in continuing the collaboration., Embedding Dimensions: 768\n",
      "Title: Talk 3-2, Content: My disclosure slide of of note, I really hate opioids for chronic pain, and I've testified against opioid manufacturers. So I'm clinically trained as a rheumatologist, and I almost always start with this slide. This isn't as relevant for headache, because, again, we don't commonly when someone comes in with a headache, we don't commonly think it's something wrong in their brain or their head, although we rule out things like brain tumors, but in when pain presents in other areas of the body, people have a tendency to think that you can see pain on an x ray or an MRI. And I'm just going to again, I'm old, so I'm going to give you a little bit of historical view of what we now call nociplastic pain, and talk about a couple different areas, about post war pain syndromes and post infectious syndromes that you probably don't hear much about, but I think help really demonstrate the breadth of sort of this construct, and the fact that, although I'm here as a pain researcher talking to you about how we think of this in the field of pain, this syndrome of nociplastic pain clearly extends well outside the classic field of chronic pain. But until the 1990s or so, we actually did think that you could see pain on an x ray. We thought that the person on the left that has an entirely normal knee X Ray would never have pain, and the person on the right that has bone on bone, osteoarthritis would always have pain. And it's not that surprising to most people that 10 or 15% of people with an X ray like the one on the left have some pain, because there's a lot of things that you wouldn't see on a plane x ray. But it is surprising to most people that don't do research in conditions like osteoarthritis that 30 or 40% of the people in the United States that have this X ray don't have any pain. They have bone on bone, they've lost all their cartilage, and they don't have any pain and and so I'm going to talk today about nociplastic Pain in the in the research into nociplastic pain has not just helped us understand how and why these individuals with without anything demonstrably wrong with their knee, can have pain. It also helps us explain why so many people that have severe anatomic damage in the periphery do not have pain. So this is basically my career of 35 or so years of being trained as a physician, I was trained as a rheumatologist, that osteoarthritis was the classic peripheral pain syndrome, and it wasn't until the 1990s that studies in low back pain and osteoarthritis started to show how poor the relationship was between what you saw on an x ray or An MRI and whether someone was experiencing pain or not, and when we see people that have pain that you can't see anything wrong on an x ray or an MRI, we immediately think that they must have prominent psychological factors like anxiety or depression or catastrophizing causing their pain. But it turns out that that's actually usually not the case. I'm not trying to deny the import of psychological factors in chronic pain, but they don't usually cause chronic pain, and some of the therapies that we thought worked really well 30 or 40 years ago, like NSAIDs and acetaminophen and opioids and even joint replacement surgery, actually often do not lead to pain relief, and the latest Cochrane meta analyzes suggest that the effect size of NSAIDs is actually quite modest. It's point 3.4 but NSAIDs in osteoarthritis of the knee don't work any better than a drug like pregabalin works in fibromyalgia. All of our analgesic drugs have, at best, small to modest effect sizes, no matter where we use them. So I'm going to talk a little bit about fibromyalgia, but more use it as a metaphor, rather than as a standalone diagnosis. Again, in the 1990s when I was being trained, people didn't really believe that Fibromyalgia was a real disease. The first criteria for fibromyalgia appeared in 1990 they require that people had widespread pain plus a certain number of tender points. These are areas that if you apply about nine pounds of pressure in these 18 regions of the body and someone says they hurt, that's considered a positive tender point. We didn't know at the time these criteria were developed, that. Women are a lot more tender than men, and because of that, these criteria inadvertently almost always identified females that these 1990 criteria, 93% of the individuals that would meet criteria for fibromyalgia in United States or anywhere else were female. Because this, these criteria unknowingly sort of bias the diagnosis towards female by requiring a certain amount of tenderness. The newer criteria for fibromyalgia that don't require a tender point count, fibromyalgia is only about one and a half or two times more common in women than in men, and that's true of almost every chronic pain condition, not just fibromyalgia, but over the last 30 to 40 years, there's been a pretty dramatic sea change in how conditions like fibromyalgia are thought of, going from conditions where people didn't even believe that these individuals were experiencing pain to now five or so years ago, where The iesp, the international group of pain researchers formally voted and said there's a third mechanism of pain. Unfortunately, they called it nociplastic pain, and so I don't like the term, but I like the fact that the international group of pain researchers formally voted and sort of codified this concept, that this third mechanism, or descriptor of pain, nociplastic pain, is very common and very important in the field of chronic pain, and that one of the ways to identify these individuals with nociplastic Pain is they don't just have pain. They have other symptoms coming from the central nervous system, because first and foremost, nociplastic pain seems to be a CNS driven problem, not a peripherally driven problem. And so I've been using this analogy for about 20 or so years. I recently did a friendly debate with Michael gold, who is an incredible sort of preclinical peripheral pain researcher, talking about the interplay between peripheral and central factors. And I asked Michael if he thought this analogy was apt, and he actually thought it was okay, so I'll continue to use it. And that is that the amount of pain that someone is experiencing is like the allowedness of an electric guitar. And there's two ways you can make an electric guitar louder. You can either strum the strings harder, or you can turn up the amplifier, and the strings of the electric guitar are analogous to all the different types of sensory nerves that we have going to different areas of the body that are picking up heat or cold, or picking up nociceptive input, or picking up where your joint is in space. But any of this information, in order for it to be felt as pain, has to go up through the spinal cord and all the way up to the brain before it can be felt as pain. And humans have fairly robust descending pathways, and the inhibitory pathways, the descending analgesic pathways, are typically more active than the descending facilitator pathways, and because of this, these pathways inhibit the upward transmission of a lot of information, a peripheral input that wouldn't serve any adaptive purpose. Most of you are probably sitting in a chair while you're listening to this talk. You have no susceptors Firing constantly in your back and your buttocks, but it's not of any adaptive purpose for you to feel this is pain. I mean, because of that, most of you have enough descending analgesic activity so that you're not feeling pain right now. But I joke about this when I give talks to groups of patients or even groups of providers, that the length of time that you can sit in a chair before your back and your buttocks starts hurting is actually a good marker of like, what your personal amplifier is set at. And there's marked differences in individuals with respect to their amplifier setting. And it turns out that women, on average, have a much higher amplifier setting than men, and this is probably one of the big reasons that women have about one and a half to two times the rate of any type of chronic pain than men. Is it simply that they're in the central nervous system. Women are more pain sensitive and they're also more sensory sensitive, and I'm going to talk a lot about this, but no so plastic pain. People are not just more sensitive to pain with respect to the brain and the amplifier, they're more sensitive to the brightness of lights, the loudness of noises, odors, and in recent studies that we're just finishing right now where we've looked done quantitative sensory testing in a number of different disease states to see what predicts when people are going to respond to surgery if They have pain or what restricts if they're going to respond to a new Dmart or anti rheumatic drug, if they have an autoimmune disease, people's perception of how bright a light is when we shine it in their eyes is a very strong predictor of non responsiveness to for example, surgery when people have. Of joint replacement surgery, and so this nociplastic pain, one of the first things that I want to emphasize is these individuals are not just pain sensitive., Embedding Dimensions: 768\n",
      "Title: Talk 3-3, Content: They're sensory sensitive to any type of sensory stimuli, and this is responsible for a lot of the symptoms that these individuals experience. They also, if you look at the far right side of the screen, the two left types of pain we've known about forever, nociceptive pain and neuropathic pain. But again, we know that these individuals with centralized or no the plastic pain, their pain is more widespread. They are sensitive to other types of sensory stimuli, and they have these other CNS symptoms like sleep problems, fatigue, memory problems and mood problems that are core to nociplastic pain. And so I'm just going to talk really briefly and rapidly about clinical studies, mechanistic studies, treatment implications, and then very briefly about some of the controversies. So again, you're seeing this term more and more. This is a lancet article some of us wrote about nociplastic pain, and there's agreement about the fact that this pathophysiologically, there's augmented CNS, pain and sensory processing, as well as the fact that these other symptoms, like fatigue, sleep problems, memory problems and mood problems are core to this kind of pain. They're not just an ancillary thing, and that the in many studies that we and other groups are doing at where we look at nuance that have nociplastic pain and children are adolescents, these symptoms typically antedate the pain. Sleep Problems are usually the first things we see in kids or adolescents that are on their way to developing new nose of plastic pain. Then you see the fatigue and the memory problems. Then you see the pain. But again, more and more studies are showing that these other CNS symptoms are really core to this syndrome. Another new set of terms you're going to hear more and more are chronic, overlapping pain conditions, a parallel term that is being used more outside of the United States, our primary pain conditions. This is a ICD 10 ICD 11 term. And primary pain essentially means that the pain is the primary problem. It's not due to osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis or some other disease that the pain seems to be the primary problem. The classic chronic overlapping pain conditions are headache and tension. Headache is fully in the cop C's. Migraine is sort of half in and half out. I'll talk a little bit about that, but we can talk about in the question and answer session, fibromyalgia, irritable bowel TMD, bladder pain syndrome, low back pain, endometriosis, these are all considered to be part of chronic overlapping pain conditions. And notice one of these here, chronic fatigue syndrome, the pain is not nearly as prominent in CFS as the fatigue, the memory problems and the sleep disturbance. And we see that in a lot of these nociplastic pain syndromes that not all of the individuals have pain as their most prominent complaint in some individuals, the memory problems, the sleep problems, the fatigue are actually more troublesome. And in addition to these conditions where nociplastic Pain is front and center, we know these same nociplastic mechanism plays significant roles in all pain conditions, about a third of individuals that start with an autoimmune disease like rheumatoid arthritis or lupus will develop superimposed central sensitization or nociplastic pain, and this occurs in sickle cell disease, erectanlose syndrome, any pain syndrome, over time, will become more and more centralized and more and more nociplastic This is a recent review article we wrote in Nature Reviews neurology, talking about the sort of pathogenic features of nociplastic pain as well as the treatments that work. And again, I'm going to talk about a couple of these very briefly to give you a broader context. Those of you in the field of pain think of pain, but I want to broaden this a little bit and talk about that these fibromyalgia, like pain conditions, can occur after people are deployed to war, after people have certain types of infections. And now we're realizing that long COVID is probably one of these sort of nosoplastic syndromes. In addition to, again, what you all know and what I'm going to mainly focus on, is that this is often a comorbidity in chronic pain conditions. In this Nature Reviews article, we talked about all the different risk factors for developing nociplastic pain. And again, I'm just going to talk about a couple of these, because most pain researchers are not familiar with these, but they help you, give you a broader context about what nociplastic syndromes really are. So it turns out that infections can trigger any of these conditions in approximately 10% of individuals. So the type of infections that historically we've known trigger a post. Infectious syndrome would be Epstein Barr Virus, Lyme disease. A number of different infections are have been historically known to cause this, and it's only infections that cause diffuse pain and fatigue that lasts for a week or so that trigger this that like common upper respiratory infections, like the common cold, don't trigger the development of sort of chronic fatigue syndrome or post infectious syndromes, but things like Epstein Barr Virus, Ross River Virus Q, fever, COVID, do trigger this in about 10% of individuals that are exposed to these more severe infections. It turns out that almost any type of infectious diarrhea will trigger irritable bowel in about 10% of individuals, and a bunch of different types of urinary tract infections trigger chronic prostatitis or interstitial cystitis. So we know that this occurs, that these infectious triggers can develop the nociplastic pain. And again, this is a super cool study that was done a long time ago in Australia that actually showed that after three markedly different types of infection, the Epstein Barr Virus, Q, fever and Borreliosis, even though the acute manifestations of those three types of infections are very different, about 10% of people that had each of those three disparate infections developed a post infectious syndrome that looked exactly like chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, and again, all three of those conditions led to the exact same about 10% of individuals this was not associated with clearance of The pathogen, with the acute inflammatory response, psychological factors, the biggest thing that predicted whether someone was going to develop one of these post infectious syndromes is whether they had some of these symptoms of fatigue or sleep or memory problems prior to the infection. And so several of us wrote, four months after the pandemic, the COVID pandemic started. We published this article in pain and said there will be a post infectious long COVID syndrome that will look a lot like post dBV syndrome and post Lyme syndrome and post SARS syndrome. No one paid attention to us, and it's only now that the couple billion dollars that are being spent by the NIH and the US to study long COVID are coming to this conclusion that long COVID Probably is largely, again, one of these syndromes, that is, that we've seen over and over and over, that infections can trigger this so can war. I'm old. I was very involved in looking at the health consequences of the first Gulf War that the United States was involved in. And after that war, it became clear that after every war that the US has ever been involved in, there's a group of veterans that come back with multifocal pain, fatigue, sleep problems and memory problems. We call it something different after every war, after the Civil War in the 1860s in the United States, this was called soldier's heart. It was called shell shock in World War One and World War Two. But again, we know that after every war that a group of veterans will come back with these sort of nosap plastic syndromes, multifocal pain, fatigue, memory problems and sleep disturbance. We just had a big conference at the University of Michigan where we devoted an entire day talking about post war syndromes. And it's becoming increasingly clear it's not just the veterans who fight in these wars, the general civilian populations in countries like Ukraine and Israel and Gaza that are torn by war have very high rates of these fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndromes. And the people that are providing for care in these countries, these are a group of individuals from Ukraine that we invited to this conference. We spent a week with them and help teach them how to take care of these conditions, because, again, they're seeing sort of an epidemic in the general population, as well as in the veterans in Ukraine, because of the fact that this is such a war torn country, cancer researchers have seen the same cluster and column the cancer symptom cluster. But again, I want to present this data to give you a sense from outside the field of pain that this syndrome is very common, and you see it virtually everywhere., Embedding Dimensions: 768\n",
      "Title: Talk 3-4, Content: So in the Nature Reviews article, we talk about the mechanisms that are involved in the nociplastic pain and fibromyalgia, there's a fairly stereotypical set of things that you see in functional brain imaging. You see a decrease in facilitator connectivity, a decrease in inhibitory connectivity. It's like the brain is hyperactive, and that some of the normal filtering mechanisms that are responsible for not allowing this information from the periphery to come up, to be brain to the brain to be filled with pain, are deficient or absent in these individuals. But But again, we. See that some of these abnormalities actually, in a recent article that Chelsea Kaplan and our group published, mining the large ABCD study, some of these imaging findings in children that subsequently go on to develop Fibromyalgia like pain are present actually at baseline before the kids develop any symptoms whatsoever, you can sort of image this risk factor or this diathesis. And so this is the the first fMRI study that was done in fibromyalgia, was done by our group and published in 2002 and all this study really did was show that when people with fibromyalgia, when we gave them a low intensity stimulus, they really were experiencing pain, because we could see that areas like the primary and secondary somatosensory cortices were being activated even though we were just giving low intensity stimuli. Our group and others have gone on to show that the two brain regions are either too connected to each other or not connected enough to each other in these nociplastic Pain states, as well as the fact that even the size and the shape of the brain changes in these nociplastic Pain states, we think this is due to neuroplasticity. And by the way, our group thinks that the same kind of neuroplasticity that we see in the brain in chronic pain, is responsible what's being for, what's being called small fiber neuropathy, that it's just, we think it's just functional reorganization the peripheral nervous system, and that it doesn't have anything to do with the pathogenesis of pain. One of the big NIH networks that we were involved in is the map network that was studying the condition that used to be called interstitial cystitis, and is now called bladder pain syndrome. But we brought a large number of individuals with the condition interstitial cystitis into this network, and we did brain imaging and all sorts of other tests in them. But one of the most striking findings in this network was that even though this label was interstitial cystitis, only about 20% of people on a body map only had pain in their bladder region. About 20% of people with interstitial cystitis had more regional pain involving their bladder and their abdomen, but about 60% of people look more like fibromyalgia patients in that they had widespread pain, fatigue, memory problem of sleep disturbance, even though the label that they were carrying was interstitial cystitis. And so we were interested in contrasting the individuals with interstitial cystitis that had pain just in their bladder with the individuals with interstitial cystitis that had pain in their bladder but had widespread pain. And what we found on functional imaging is that the people with interstitial cystitis that only had pain in their bladder looked almost identical to healthy controls and functional MRI, whereas the people with interstitial cystitis that had the widespread pain phenotype, even though what they were being called was interstitial cystitis and functional imaging, they looked almost identical to fibromyalgia patients. So again, we can sort of image this brain that seems to be hyper responsive to painful stimuli, hyper responsive to other type of sensory stimuli. It may be the case that the endogenous opioid system is participating in the pathogenesis of these nociplastic Pain states, and this may be one of the reasons it's it's such a bad idea to use opioids to treat chronic pain. I know those of you in the headache field have been recommending against opioid use forever, just like those of us in the fibromyalgia field have been recommending against opioid use forever, but people don't necessarily listen to us, and they're still widely using opioids. And I'm concerned that opioids don't just not take make pain better, that they actually, in some individuals, giving them an opioid mechanistically, will actually make their pain worse and worse over time, and one of the reasons for that is a study we did where we used pet with Carfentanil, a highly potent opioid and functional MRI at the same time in people with fibromyalgia, and it literally looked as though the endogenous opioid system was releasing too much endorphins and enkephalins, and that over release of endogenous opioids, of endorsements and keflins was leading to opioid induced hyperalgesia. So in this article, we said we think that nociplastic pain might be, in part, endogenous opioid induced hyperalgesia, because we think that the endogenous opioid system may be hyperactive in contributing to this sort of wind up that we see in these individuals. And one of the reasons that I rant about this all the time is These are data from last year showing that in the United States, in 2023 40% of fibromyalgia patients are either getting oxycodone or hydrocodone, strong opioids for which there's absolutely. No evidence that they work. And so again, I give an hour long talks on the problems with opioids. I'm just going to give a five minute rant about this. But the first thing you should understand as someone who's done been involved in litigation and has seen a lot of data and FDA files and things like that, is there's actually not a single study that has lasted for 12 weeks or longer of a pure mu opioid that shows that opioids actually, in a parallel group, randomized control trial, are effective in treating chronic pain, and the only studies that are carried out longer term, for up to a year, are studies of drugs like buprenorphine or to pentadol, which are mixed opioids and really have entirely different profiles than a pure mu opioid like oxycodone or hydrocodone, which are the ones that are being primarily used. The other thing that a lot of providers are not aware of is addiction is not the primary safety issue with opioid use and chronic pain, all cause mortality is the primary safety issue. If someone that has chronic pain is taking an opioid, the risk of them dying of any cause is about double, and that's because they're at higher risk of developing, of dying of a motor traffic accident if they're on opioids, higher risk of suicide, higher risk of MIS there's a tremendous number of things that opioids kill you from that are not addiction, that that a lot of providers and patients are unaware of, this dramatic increase in all cause mortality. And again, there's a very real possibility that opioids make pain worse in a subset of individuals, not just don't make pain better. Two studies I'm going to show you that that scare me, because, again, there are no industry funded trials that show that opioids work. This is a famous study done by Aaron Krebs. It was published about six years ago that showed it in chronic pain patients with back pain that NSAIDs and opioids. The the main finding was that, looking at pain interference, that opioids were no better than non steroidals. But look at the second line here. People didn't pay attention to this. There was actually a statistically significant worsening in pain intensity in the people that were randomized to get opioids at one year, compared to the people that not were randomized to get NSAIDs at one year. And then this is a more recent trial that was done for acute low back pain and neck pain, again, randomizing people to either opioids or NSAIDs, carried out for a year. It wasn't the primary outcome measure, but buried in there, first of all, are the tables that show that the opioid treated patients are worse in every way possible at all points in time. They have higher rates of anxiety, depression, everything, they just look worse in every possible way. And then this graph should be scary to anyone that ever gives a chronic pain patient an opioid again, it's flipped the opposite of what you would hope to see if you thought an opioid was working for chronic pain, and that the people that were treated with an opioid had a higher pain intensity at one year than the people that were treated with NSAIDs. And so I joke about this, but this should be a cortical tattoo that that anyone that's prescribing an opioid for chronic pain. I hope that if that, if nothing else from this talk, that you remember this slide, and this is permanently etched into your brain, that there's a lot of data suggesting that opioids actually make pain worse the longer you use them., Embedding Dimensions: 768\n",
      "Title: Talk 3-5, Content: And this is a cool study that was done recently showing that even a condition like knee osteoarthritis, using GWAS and using genetic analyzes, it looks like about half of the pain in osteoarthritis is coming from peripheral factors, and about half of the pain is coming from Central factors. And this prompted me to write an editorial. I was asked to write an editorial in response to this article, chiding is, why doesn't everyone use a body map in every chronic pain patient? Because even in our group, where we do functional brain imaging and all the quantitative sensory testing and all these really cool things, right now, a body map, just getting a body map on a chronic pain patient tells you probably more about what's going to work and what's not going to work in that patient than almost anything. The more widespread their pain is, the more regions of pain they have, the more likely their pain is coming from the central nervous system, and the less likely that peripherally directed treatments are going to work. And again, some studies are actually suggesting that we can sort of image this vulnerability of nociplastic pain vulnerability. This is the study that I was alluding to earlier, that Chelsea was a leader author of that showed that in kids that are healthy and pain free that in the next year do develop multi site pain on brain imaging, they have half of the findings of fibromyalgia while they're asymptomatic at age nine. Pain before they develop any pain. And this is a different study that Irene Tracy was involved in that was published recently, that showed that you could predict the individuals who are going to develop chemotherapy induced neuropathic pain by doing brain imaging. Because you're imaging how the central nervous system is going to respond to that damaged nerve. I don't actually think that a damaged nerve in and of itself is always painful. Most types of neuropathy. About half of the people have painless neuropathy, and about half of the people have painful neuropathy, and our group thinks that that's largely due to how the central nervous system responds to that damaged nerve, not to the damaged nerve per se. So when we go back to the slide, one of the first things we have to realize is that these names down here are, they're all mixed pain states that a third of people with osteoarthritis or autoimmune disorders or cancer pain also have central sensitization, fibromyalgia, nociplastic pain. So and when people have multiple pain mechanisms, you're going to have to use treatments that are based on those pain mechanisms. Again, just because someone carries the label of osteoarthritis doesn't mean that the preferred treatment for this individual might be a drug like duloxetine that is clearly working in the central nervous system. And so these are the new Fibromyalgia criteria. They look at how widespread the pain is. On the left by asking people to check boxes in a body map. They ask about the symptoms, like memory problems, sleep problems and fatigue, and they're scored. This is scored from zero to 31 and we think this is right now the best measure for the degree of nociplastic pain that someone has a body map alone isn't bad. But I think by asking people about fatigue, sleep problems and memory problems, you can predict additional variants. And Fred Wolf is a Fibromyalgia researcher that pointed out that we shouldn't think of fibromyalgia or nociplastic paint, or yes or no, the different people have different degrees of this. And he coined the term Fibromyalgia ness to indicate this, I'm not suggesting you use this term. I'm suggesting you understand the concept that it's better to think of this, that people have differing degrees or different volume control settings, rather than to think of fibromyalgia or nociplastic pain or being yes or no. And to give you an example of how powerful a body map is, imagine that you're not a headache specialist, you're a knee specialist, and someone comes into you with knee pain, and you're thinking about whether you should do surgery or not. Well, if you don't give a body map, and someone comes into you with knee pain, you might think that they're going to respond to knee replacement surgery, but is someone with this body map likely to respond if you inject their knee or do surgery on their knee, the intuitive thing would be no. And I'll show you some data that shows like, really no. And so we actually have used the fibromyalgia measure in the perioperative period, first in knee and hip replacement surgery, and then subsequently in his in women with chronic pelvic pain that we're getting a hysterectomy to control their pain, and we showed that someone's score on the fibromyalgia measure on the day of surgery is highly predictive of how much opioid they're going to need to control their acute pain. The higher their score, the less well that opioids are going to work to control their acute pain. Don't get me started on treating their chronic pain with this as well as the higher the score in the fibromyalgia measure, the less likely that people were going to respond to the surgery. So in these studies, we didn't just collect the fibromyalgia measure. We collected anxiety, depression, catastrophizing, but on the day of surgery, we gave people this Fibromyalgia measure, which can be scored zero to 31 and again, our main hypothesis was that this measure would be predictive of surgery non responsiveness and opioid non responsiveness, and it was dramatically predictive is that each one point increase in the fibromyalgia score people needed nine milligrams more of omes to control their acute pain in the first 24 to 48 hours, each one point Increase in the fibromyalgia score made people less surgery responsive. These phenomena were linear, just like Fred said, there wasn't anything magical where the a score of 13 or higher, and that Fibromyalgia measure is said to be diagnostic of fibromyalgia. But it didn't matter if someone had 13 or higher, or they had 10 or 11 or whatever. Each one point increase in the fibromyalgia score made people less surgery responsive and less opioid responsive. And I'll just show that here is that these are two individuals with different Fibromyalgia scores. On the x axis here on the bottom is the fibromyalgia score. On the y axis is the number of people that had that score. So this study had about 700 people in it that got their knee or their hip replaced. This person here doesn't have fibromyalgia because he doesn't have a Fibromyalgia score of greater than 13. But look at how different these two people were after they had knee replacement surgery. Patient B would need 90 milligrams more. Of omes, of opioid to control his acute pain, and patient B would be five times less likely to have a 50% improvement in his pain if he did go on to have his knee operated on., Embedding Dimensions: 768\n",
      "Title: Talk 3-6, Content: And then we exactly replicated those findings in subsequent studies in women getting hysterectomy for chronic pelvic pain. And so why is this all important? Well, this is one of the reasons that the treatments that work for acute pain and work somewhat well for nociceptive pain, like NSAIDs, opioids, these drugs down here don't work at all for this kind of pain. And so the first thing is you have to use different types of drugs, tricyclic drugs, serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors and gabapentinoids are the most effective drugs to treat the spectrum of illness. And then again, instead of giving people opioids where there's some evidence that drugs like low dose naltrexone, where we're actually blocking the endogenous opioid system, might be helpful in treating this, and the drug duloxetine, to give you an example, we at the time that duloxetine was approved for use in chronic low back pain and in chronic musculoskeletal pain in the United States, we didn't know who with low back pain this was going to work in but subsequent studies showed that if you take someone with low back pain and you give them A body map, you can identify the people who are going to be more responsive to duloxetine, the people who have more sites of pain on the body map are going to be more likely to respond to duloxetine. And in this study, people the The study showed that if someone had five or more sites of pain besides the back and even though their diagnosis was low back pain, that these people were 60% more likely to respond to duloxetine than someone that had low back pain but only had a single site of pain in the back and similarly for osteoarthritis, duloxetine is going to work better if someone has multifocal pain, rather than just pain in one region of the body. I suspect this is true for using geloxitine in headache patients, but I don't know of any studies that have actually shown this. But I also I want to emphasize how important the use of non drug therapies are in these pain syndromes, because drugs and procedures are sort of working up at the top here. But when someone has chronic pain, they develop increased stress, they become less active, they sleep poor they gain weight, they develop bad habits, and we have to use non pharmacologic therapies to treat those conditions. When I wrote a review article on fibromyalgia and published it in JAMA 10 years or so ago, these were the non pharmacologic therapies that had a good evidence base. And notice that a lot of the non pharmacologic therapies were in weak evidence. There was only one flavor of cowginative behavioral therapy, and there was only one type of exercise that we thought worked for nociplastic pain. Now look at a 2024, version of this. First of all, you see that all of these things that used to be down here moved up. The evidence base for all these non pharmacologic therapies is increasing dramatically as studies are being done in different pain syndromes of yoga, tai chi, bio feedback, acupuncture, acupressure, the evidence base keeps increasing dramatically, and now we even have five types of cognitive behavioral therapy. We can use classic pain based CBT. We can use brief CBT, empowered. We can do CBT for insomnia, acceptance, Commitment Therapy, emotional awareness therapy. There's a whole potpourri of cognitive behavioral approaches now that and again, different subsets of chronic pain patients are going to probably respond different to different types of therapy. This is a website that our group developed by Dave Williams, that is under a lot of testing in different NIH trials, because we think that websites and apps can be really helpful to get people some of these therapies that we now refer to as integrative therapies, these therapies that we used to be dismissive of and call complementary and alternative therapies, like acupuncture, acupressure, yoga, are now mainstream therapies, and the preferred term for these therapies are things like integrative therapies. I always like showing this slide because in the VA in the DoD medical centers in the United States, these are all the treatments that are theoretically available, all of these integrative therapies now are reimbursed within the VA and DoD systems. This is more of an aspiration to most of us that take care of chronic pain patients. We'd love for our patients to have access to all of these therapies and to have third party payers cover these therapies, but most insurance doesn't cover most of these therapies now, and most patients, and because of that, don't have access to most of these therapies. So really quickly, what is the role of psychological factors in this spectrum of illness? Some people this article implied that all people with conditions like. Fibromyalgia have prominent psychological factors driving their pain. We wrote a editorial pushing back on this and saying that that's way too simplistic, that in a lot of individuals with conditions like fibromyalgia or nociplastic pain, the sleep problems, the fatigue, the memory problems, there's a lot of other ways that you can get to know some plastic pain and focusing inordinately on the psychological comorbidities. And there's also a lot of slides that suggest that the anxiety, the depression and catastrophizing that people with chronic pain develop, it's because of the pain, and if you make the pain better, you will often make those psychological comorbidities better. Another reason we feel this way is that a new onset of fibromyalgia in children, mood disorders like problems with anxiety and depression, were not a risk for developing new Fibromyalgia in children. Sleep Problems were attention or memory problems were being a female was but having negative affect was not associated with the subsequent development of new multi site pain or new fibromyalgia. Small fiber neuropathy. I don't think small fiber neuropathy has been shown to cause hardly anything in the field of chronic pain. I think this is just much ado about nothing. I just gave a talk at the International pain meetings about this, and this was the slide that I think everyone should look at. This is a review article that I had nothing to do with. It was published a couple years ago that shows all the different medical conditions that have been associated with small fiber neuropathy, and notice all of these conditions, most of which are not in any way associated with chronic pain. So people that have only heard about small fiber neuropathy from the advocates of this concept in the pain field don't get shown this slide and don't get shown that small fiber neuropathy has been shown in almost any condition where it's been looked for. It's an incredibly non specific finding that, again, has not yet been shown in any way to cause pain. And then finally, there's some people that are claiming that conditions like fibromyalgia are autoimmune diseases. I have to play whack a mole and debate these individuals as well. Again, there's overwhelming evidence. Rheumatologist, a long time ago, discarded the term fibrositis because we could see that this was really quite different than rheumatoid arthritis or lupus, which are autoimmune diseases, and where the inflammation strikes you in the face that these conditions, the like fibromyalgia, in fact, are not autoimmune diseases. So I'll stop there and take any questions that people might have., Embedding Dimensions: 768\n",
      "Title: Talk 3-7, Content: I'm just, let me just start off by asking one question, because in looking at your presentation, there's, from my standpoint, there's not a lot that I certainly I would disagree with, but I mentioned, but you mentioned psycho psychological factors, initially you started talking about those not being predictors of outcome, and I think of trauma and PTSD. And had a couple slides sort of suggesting that, but then you also presented slides with war trauma and so on and so forth, which sort of speaks to PTSD as predictor. And there's certainly a robust literature on trauma being at least somewhat of a predictor of treatment resistant pain syndromes. My concern is there's always folks that would really like to not ask questions of the patient about trauma and history, and that this not be a ticket to avoiding that, because they could focus on other other thoughts. I again, I found some of the data you presented sort of essentially conflicting.So I entirely agree with you, Ron. I think that people should ask about trauma. What I am bothered by is that article that we pushed back on said everyone with fibromyalgia has this, you know, psychological problem, and that you probably know this therapeutically, if you approach someone you know with chronic pain that has anxiety and depression and that is not their primary problem, it's really more depression that's reactive to the fact that they can't live a normal life because of their pain that those individuals are resent you viewing like the psychological factors as their major problem, rather than something that's sort of downstream of having chronic pain and so all I'm really and in that article that we wrote that push back on this, one of the co authors of the article has been involved in a. Out of the really large epidemiologic studies of chronic, widespread pain, slash fibromyalgia, and he could calculate that adverse childhood experiences or ACEs might like in a big population based study account for about 8% of the individuals with conditions like fibromyalgia. So that's the is like, yes, there are. There is a group of people with chronic pain where this is being caused and driven by trauma, but there's also a big group where it's not, and where those people sometimes resent that, you know, putting the psychological thing as the major cause of their pain. And so I'm really just trying to get people to realize there's a continuum. And don't think that every time you see someone with anxiety or depression or catastrophizing or adverse childhood experiences in the background, for that matter, that that's the cause of their nosap plastic pain, because the data suggest it's more complicated than that. Well, you say CBT is a strong as strong evidence, right? And I think that we're trying to still figure out the some of the most exciting cognitive behavioral approaches are things like emotional awareness therapy, which may actually specifically help these people with trauma, because it is more of a trauma based therapy. And some of the early reports of EA T are that you identify people that some of the people that you give this to, like, are cured of their pain, or get 7080, 90% better that you don't see with plain old pain? CBT, so I think these approaches are really exciting, and we're trying to do studies now that say, you know, what are the baseline factors that so you can identify someone where these kind of trauma based cognitive behavioral approaches, you know, may work very well, and you should approach that and give those people this therapy. But again, if I had to put this in just a guess, I'd say probably 20, 30% of chronic pain patients might really benefit from this, these kinds of approaches where the psychological thing is front and center and is causing their pain, and if you treat it as such, they might benefit in the other 60 or 70% it's an important symptom, and it needs to be addressed, but it isn't necessarily pathogenically causing their pain. And the driving thing that if you make that better, you're going to make them better., Embedding Dimensions: 768\n",
      "Title: Talk 3-8, Content: Yes, excellent talk. Dan, I would like to ask you, especially because chronic pain, many of the chronic disorders are associated with gender and and sex difference. So what are the evidence from your group or from other groups that biological, neurologically, you have to explain that many of this chronic pain disorders affect the more woman, for example, than men. So we and others have done studies that show that if you do quantitative sensory testing in girls and boys before puberty, they they're not. They are identical. Girls and boys are, they have the same sort of pain processing, and we see this in the ABCD data as well. After girls go through puberty, that's when you see the onset of a lot of these chronic overlapping pain conditions. And that's where you see sort of after adolescence that girls, slash women develop this one and a half to two times increased frequency of almost every chronic pain syndrome in conditions like osteoarthritis. You can look at this really easily, because you can image like what's going on in the knee versus whether someone experiences pain. And going back to what I was showing that slide I showed really early, where I said 30 or 40% of the people in the United States that have that X ray, that's bone on bone, don't have any pain. Those are almost all men, because, again, on average, men are in the central nervous system, are less pain sensitive. The current evidence suggests that it's not female sex hormones that are driving this. It's actually the absence of testosterone that there's a lot of data that suggests that male sex hormones are anti nociceptive, and that that actually may more so, because we have these experiments in nature, we have pregnancy and menopause, where estrogens go super high or go to non existent, and those don't reproducibly cause any change in pain sensitivity and quantitative sensory testing and things like that. So in a lot of evidence, including a study that we're involved in of transgender individuals that are getting gender affirming therapy, people. That are transitioning from female to male by using androgens, or people that are transitioning from male to female by using androgen blockers. This is a experiment that is now being done by a lot of individuals, and we're just super imposing research. But again, a lot of the data is suggesting that the individuals who transition in the direction of males have less pain over time, and the people that transition in the female direction have more pain because they essentially convert hormonally, you know, to the the milieu that will make them more pain sensitive., Embedding Dimensions: 768\n",

      "Title: Talk 4-2, Content: Thank you very much for that warm introduction, and it's so nice to meet you all virtually from all across the world, from so many different disciplines. And, you know, perspectives really on on the medical world. I was very excited to be invited to this, since there is the patient perspective, the physician perspective, and it's an interdisciplinary discussion, and ketamine certainly is interdisciplinary as well. So I was tasked with the discussion of the pros and cons, and not to be biased, but I will let you know that I do believe in ketamine, and so that's my first bias before I show you any slide, but I will still be critical of some of the data that does exist, and I will be cognizant of time, and I will make sure to leave time for questions, and I look forward to our vibrant conversation this morning. So with a little bit of introduction, if my slides move, there we go. This is Monte Medical Center. Again, I do wear a few different hats. The most important one is mom and wife. But in addition to that, almost equal to that, is my passion from my vocation. I split my time between working in the perioperative environment, in the regional anesthesia world, covering the Acute Pain Service as well as the other half of my life is spent working with chronic pain patients. And I have a fascination of the acute on chronic pain patient as well, and a love of ketamine. So what are we actually going to be talking about today? I want to be fair, and let me just go up for one moment. I have a special thank you to give to one of my fellows, Dominique Chang, who did help me put together with some of these slides. And I'm very fair about this. I want to give credit where she wears due when she graduates, wherever she will go, she will be a superstar. So today, we're going to talk a little bit about history pharmacology, ketamine in the acute pain world, ketamine in the chronic pain world, and then ketamine for depression and PTSD. Because I think one of the most exciting things about ketamine is it's kind of like salt. You can put it in a lot of different recipes, and it still can be very valuable. And, you know, I think there's been a lot of that other uses. So you know, it's not just one, one peg that goes into a specific hole. It can be a little bit ubiquitous if you know how to use the tool in your hand. So let's talk a little bit about the history of ketamine. What is this medication anyway, and where, how did it even kind of, how do we even start thinking about it? Well, in the 1950s there was a new system that was a new chemical, organic reaction that led to the synthesis of something called PCP. And initially it was planned to be a medical compound, but they kind of noticed that it causes increases in blood pressure and nystagmus, and it did maintain respiration, but then at the same time, there were a lot of severe excitation and for profound psychosis. Hence, when it became a drug of substance abuse, as opposed to an excellent tool for clinical care. But there was something there in the water, and so they found a new compound eventually that had all the positive qualities of PCP, without the major side effects and the severe excitation and the profound psychosis, and that was the one that was eventually called ketamine in 1964 it was used in veterinary medicine first, and it's still used today for veterinary medicine, it was noted to show an excited drunken state in rodents, but kind of a Cate leptoid state in pigeons. And the first human actually received it between 1964 and 1966 and there was a study of over 100 people that was noted and published, and they received these sub anesthetic IV doses, and patients were able to actually report talking about these strange experience of feeling like they were floating and having no arms or legs, and others felt like they were dead. And came back. Well, fast forward to 1970 Kennedy received FDA approval after appropriate clinical trials, and during the Vietnam War, it became actually a widely used anesthetic and wounded victims with hemodynamic instability. And now, if we look at today, it's a modern tool in our toolbox, and has been used in clinical practice for about more than 50 years. In 1985 it was actually. It named an essential medicine by the WHO and actually was thought to be one of the most common anesthetics in the world. You know, recently, due to the opiate crisis, which I'm sure my audience is, is highly aware about, there was a renewed interest in ketamine, both for the acute and chronic pain spheres, and we'll be talking about that as well in terms of more recent guidelines, and even more recently than that, even in the last five years, it was actually proved as a nasal spray for the treatment of new indications, such as resistant depression. It's also been used for other medical disorders such as anxiety and suicidal ideation. So, you know, there's a lot of publicity in this world. This is a sample of an anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation newsletter from June of 2020 it talked about the potential benefits and side effects of ketamine, and also the history of ketamine. It's important to appreciate the fact that you can maintain respiratory drive, minimize cardiovascular depression, attenuate opiate induced hyperalgesia, provided as an adjuvant, acute on chronic pain, choice as an adjuvant, and it actually has anti suicidal and antidepressant properties. On the flip side, you still had to pay attention to some of the negative negatives, such as increased airway secretions and minimizing airway reflux attenuation, it can still be a sympathetic in elevating your heart rate, your blood pressure. Patients who are close to an MI with severe CAD should be used with caution with this medication. And of course, the hallucinations, confusions, vivid dreams and delirium are possible. There are these classic YouTube and Tiktok videos of parents taking pictures of their kids after some kind of surgery on who have received ketamine, where they're a little bit laughing at their kids separate conversation. But you may have seen those kind of videos on the internet, also double vision and blurry vision, and so this was a nice little review piece here, because it was actually discussing some of the benefits to review this established but kind of underappreciated medication, which might be the theme of this talk. That being said, we have to speak with caution, because ketamine gained recent publicity in December of 2023 where it showed that a very famous actor in the social world of the US, Matthew Perry, who had been a character and friends for many years, died as a result of the acute effects of ketamine and subsequent drowning. He was known to have been using this medication for depression and anxiety. And it was noted, though, that outside of the weekly depression dosing, he might have had actually higher levels of ketamine in his system that was found in his post mortem assessment. Sadly, the death was ruled to be an accident. But you know this, this is something where we talk about the discerning eye of ketamine. So let's talk a little bit about the pharmacology of ketamine. Okay, what is this drug that's so powerful it does so many things? Well, there's a few antimers of it. It has RNs. Thank you. Organic Chemistry. The s anti antemer is actually considered about three to four times more potent than its cousin, and has a greater affinity for the PCP binding receptor. The S version has a shorter duration of action and possesses greater neuro protective and analgesic properties than its R component, which might actually potentially make it a more ideal analgesic. But preclinical and clinical analgesic studies comparing the two have thus kind of yielded conflicting data so far in terms of abuse, potential studies comparing the two antimers have also produced mixed results. But for depression, two animal studies did demonstrate more sustained anti depression effects for the R antiandre, but there's no really clinical studies to guide this. Just know that there are two directions that ketamine can take., Embedding Dimensions: 768\n",
      "Title: Talk 4-3, Content: It's important to understand the mechanism of action, and this becomes a very important slide later on down the line. So one of the things, before we even look at any slides here, that I talk about with all of my trainees are that Pain Physicians have two roles. We are the electricians of the body, and we are also the chefs. So in terms of electricity, we understand that there are a lot of different receptors that exist in the human body, and so we have to figure out, when we're trying to attack the pain bomb, is it the yellow wire, the blue wire, the green water? What are we trying to actually address in order to cut the bomb so that the pain doesn't go off? Well, the primary mechanism of action when we talk about ketamine has to do with a non competitive antagonism at the PCP binding site of the NMDA receptor in the CNS, particularly in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, where it decreases the frequency of the channel opening and the time spent in the active open state. It's also important to appreciate how with a dose response, the ketamine act. Activating opioid receptors changes over time. So this becomes really important in our discussion, because we talk about sub anesthetic doses, anesthetic doses when we talk about CRPS, you know, people talk about half a milligram per kilogram in the perioperative state, and even when we're talking about the beginnings of treatment for CRPS. But if you go to the VA in the DC area. You know, those patients have been known to have ketamine coma infusions for their post amputation stump pain, and those are extremely high doses. So, you know, it's the opposite of the limbo. Not how low can you go, but sometimes how high can you go. And also an appreciation of the fact that the receptor stimulation will change depending on what is the dose that's being acquired. Also, the analgesic effects are not reversed by Naloxone, which is also a separate interesting concept here, because this might not be the source of the anti nociception. And also, when ketamine and Naloxone, there's there have been recent studies actually talking about ketamine and Naloxone for depression. So when they're trying to figure out how it works for other receptors, the antidepressant qualities of the ketamine are not reversed by Naloxone, which indicates that it's not just the NMDA receptor, but actually, in many discussions, there's a facilitation of on the third section, gabapentin, gabapentinoid type receptors. And so this might be where not only are we using it for analgesia, but where we're really exploring the other part of pain management, the the part of being an electrician of the human body, affecting the brain, affecting depression, anxiety. And so I think there's a lot of room here in the world of neuroscience to help with both analgesia, anxiety and other psychiatric comorbidities. So it's a very exciting drug that can be multi faceted in its usage. There's lots of roots of administration, IV, im, intranasal, topical, oral, rectal. One of the things we'll talk about later on is is, is money, because not everybody has access to ketamine. And I'll, I'll just say that in many of my patients in chronic pain, where I do think ketamine can be useful, sometimes I'll prescribe them a ketamine cream, just because I don't always have access to all of the other forms of ketamine for them in the outpatient setting. So just keep in mind that there's lots of ways to have ketamine administered to a patient. That being said, the bioavailability and distribution certainly vary, as you can see here, in this in this description, from im to I intranasal to PO. And so that's an important appreciation. It's really the active metabolite which has a 30% potency of ketamine. And metabolites are mainly excreted in the urine. So you really want to appreciate what is the root of administration and the distribution, the bioavailability, as you're choosing this medication, and in what form it's going to be given. And the half life is about two and a half hours or so. So again, important for After Effects, patients should not go home alone after this medication. Patients should have a supportive environment if they're going to be using these kind of medications. Okay, I briefly mentioned this before, but we do appreciate the fact that ketamine is a sympathomimetic effects. There's an increase in many of the cardiovascular typical descriptors. What's good is that the respiratory diminuation is quite low in this and so it is considered a good drug, that it can be a drug for difficult airways or for patients who have OSA need to be maintained is part of their anesthetic. It does increase the secretions, though, so it's recommended to give something against the secretions and and also, you will see patients with a very clear dissociative state due to this functional electrophysiological separation of their, of their, of their systems here. So while the eyes may remain open, pupils are dilated. Sometimes they're speaking to you, but sometimes they're not. As the dosage goes up, you know, patients have essentially, quote, unquote, dissociated from their body. And a little factoid is that one of this discovery, the discoverers of ketamine, his wife, actually named that that dissociative state always. Thank your wife. All right, that being said, we said all these interesting things about ketamine and all the things it does. What are the things that we don't like so much about ketamine? Well, it's certainly outside of secretions. Can cause post operative nausea and vomiting. It can cause emergence, delirium, hallucinations. It could cause weird and unpleasant dreams. Can be a little bit painful, and injection especially, and an overdose is associated with loss of consciousness. An overdose would cause respiratory depression and all of the cardiovascular effects and as well as severe psycho mimetic events, including positive and negative signs of schizophrenia. So these are things to just keep in the back of your mind. Of the negative part if we're going to criticize ketamine. Okay, I gave you a little bit of background on ketamine, a little history. We talked a little bit about the mechanics of it. Now let's talk about acute pain medicine. Okay, so in 2018 something relatively revolutionary happened because multiple societies came together and said, We're going to put a consensus statement on ketamine. And so the American Society of regional anesthesia and pain medicine, the American Academy of pain medicine and the ASA, or the American Society of Anesthesiologists, put a discussion on intravenous use of ketamine infusions out there in the world, and this is a PubMed practice guideline in one of the large pain medicine journals, or the regional anesthesia Pain Medicine Journal, as it's known. Speakers are from many that I know. They're wonderful people. They're from their leaders in the field. And so putting together a three society statement like this was considered a very powerful thing. Notice, this is 2018 we've been using this drug for 50 years, so maybe it's about time. But isn't it nice that we at least have somewhere to start from to kind of we have our first recipe book. So this was done in 2018 not so long ago., Embedding Dimensions: 768\n",
      "Title: Talk 4-4, Content: So what's the summary of the guidelines. Well, sub anesthetic ketamine infusions should be considered for patients undergoing painful surgeries. This is Grade B recommendation with a moderate level of certainty. So there's some evidence that exists, as well as the consensus of the societies. Ketamine can be considered also for opiate dependent and opiate tolerant patients undergoing surgery, which is a very important topic, which we'll get into shortly, because the evidence is a little limited with case reports and series. You know, when we talk about specifically acute or chronic sickle cell pain, you know, while these patients suffer so much, in fact, Montefiore happens to be a sickle cell center. The grade recommendation is Class C, because we don't have the evidence behind it, and also for patients with sleep apnea, I mentioned it earlier, having may be considered as an adjunct to limit opiates. Again, Grade C recommendation because there's not enough data. Now, please keep in mind not enough data doesn't mean that it doesn't work. It just means that we have to prove it. Still perhaps I'll tell you I'm a strong believer in both of these in my clinical practice, but again, I need to show you the evidence, if I'm going to be fair in this conversation. Okay, remember what I talked about before? Salt can be a little bit or a lot. It affects the recipe. It affects the dosing. It affects what we do, depending on what is the purpose of the ketamine and in what context we're using, just like lidocaine and an epidural, there are changes in dosing suggestions, right? So whether it's an anesthetic induction, dose of bolus, dosing, analgesia, sedation, or treatment resistant depression, these are very clear different dosing. There's also these ketamine clinics that have been set up where people come in for a little short infusion, you know? And they do this a few times in a month or so, so. So there are many ways to use this drug. That being said, the literature does not support infusions above one milligram per kilogram per hour in a setting without intensive monitoring. Okay. So keep that in mind. Unfortunately, Matthew Perry may not have been in that, in that in that range individuals of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics can also affect this, and so you might need to think about dosings either higher or lower I had. I remember when I was a fellow, many moons ago, one of my favorite patients was this Vietnam War veteran who unfortunately had a head and neck cancer and had been exposed to Agent Orange, and he had this tumor that was growing out of his neck, and was on this, these high doses of drugs. It was methadone at the time, but you know, that was his PCA, and no matter how much we gave him, he just was awake. So, you know, we do have to appreciate that there are extremes in all these situations. So these are guidelines, but they don't affect all patients. Adverse effects may also prevent you from getting as high as you want to in many cases. For the chronic pain world, when we're doing this, you might I used to run a continuous versat infusion in order to mitigate with some of the psycho mimetic effects. And we would also be doing serial lft testing to make sure, again, that there were no changes to that. We'll get into that a little bit later on. But again, the dose dependent reactions are limited by what you are trying to achieve, and also the limitations of the side effect profile for each patient. Okay, so what's the evidence to support ketamine infusions as an adjuvant to opioids and other therapies. Well, overall, it was concluded that there is moderate evidence to support sub anesthetic IV doses up to point three five milligrams per kilogram and for infusions up to one milligram per kilogram per hour as an adjuvant to opioids in the perioperative period. So at least we have pretty decent evidence that perioperatively can. I mean, is a good thing, okay? What about contraindications? Well, I kind of alluded to some of them, already very poorly controlled, cardiovascular disease, pregnancy, active psychosis, hepatic dysfunction and elevated intracranial pressure and elevated intraocular pressure. Does any evidence support ivpca for ketamine? Well, evidence is kind of limited in this area as a sole analgesic for acute and perioperative pain, so it's a grade C recommendation, low letter, low level of certainty, but there is moderate evidence to support the benefit of addition of ketamine as an opiate based ivpca For acute and perioperative pain management, Grade B evidence. So there's good literatures to support that. Keep in mind, again, you have to have appropriate staff and monitoring on the on the floors for these kind of patients. So there are other aspects in terms of systems based practice that need to be considered for perioperative management, including ketamine. Okay, we talked a little bit about intranasal and there is some literature, but it's still great to see evidence, at least for patients who have difficult IV access, or children who are going procedures in terms of oral ketamine. If we look at the guidelines from 2018 that the evidence was less robust, but small studies and anecdotal reports suggested it might provide a short term benefit in some individuals with acute pain. And so this was a grade C recommendation, but one of the things I'm proud to tell you, which was just published one week ago, and actually the senior author on this was my old fellow who is now director of pain in Albany, Eric Silverman, they did a recent study in combination with Jefferson, with Eric, combining oral administered ketamine and the post operative opiate use in colorectal surgery. And this was a retrospective cohort, but they were able to show that there were fewer readmissions and that there was a preservation of reduced perioperative opioid use, suggesting an opiate sparing effect. It's not a perfect study. Obviously. There was an insignificant loss of length of stay change. There were no observed increase in ICU admissions, which is great, but I think this is a pretty exciting discussion since the institution's initiation of eras pathways in 2019 after the original studies came out. So here we go. We have more promising data, and this is from one week ago, so this is at recent as it gets Okay, so let's just briefly talk about a few questions. Who are the patients that we can treat Well, patients who are opiate tolerant, patients who are opiate naive, patients who are in the perioperative setting. Where can we treat patients well? Infusions are great, as I mentioned before, but outside of the operating room setting, or, you know, maybe a little bit challenging here, perioperatively, pacu ICU settings may be wonderful locations, but we still have to keep in mind all the potential side effects. So they do need to be an appropriate moderate setting, whatever that is at your institution, and what's the right dose. I think that there, again, depending on what the purposes of the ketamine, there are different dosing. There's not exactly a clear dose related dependent relationship because of also the second memetic effects. But there's things to explore in this area. Okay, as we transition our discussion between acute to chronic pain. We do have to at least make mention of persistent post surgical pain. Ppsp, new, new, new definition, old concept, the people who are acute pain or acute pain people, the people who are chronic pain, people as as classically defined as patients who have pain for more than three months are chronic pain people. What are those middle range people that are a little bit like, it's kind of prolonged, but it's not perfect, and we got to figure out, you know, they have a little bit more pain they're supposed to, and they're still bothering their surgeon after whatever procedure. And obviously this affects breast, this affects knee, this affects, you know, many different pathways. And so there's, there's been a an increase in the exploration of these areas. And this is just a few little samples from the regional anesthesia and Pain Medicine Journal of studies that have been put out there discussing random, prospective observational studies, cross sectional survey analysis, perspective of observational study again. And so I think it's just at least important to appreciate the fact that this is a hot topic and that we are starting to put a little focus on it. So what about post surgical, persistent pain and ketamine? Is there a future? Well, the individual studies are underpowered at this point in time. There is a meta analysis that showed a very small effect. The number needed to treat of 12 at three months and 14 at six months. So we still have to do a little bit better in this area. But you know, it's worth the exploration, and this is part of also where different versions of ketamine, especially intranasal, might continue to be useful for these acute on chronic pain episodes that's been mostly studied in the. Emergency Medicine setting, where it provides benefit briefly, but potent, especially good for procedures, but in terms of this persistent pain that exists for long term use, the jury's still out, and hopefully we'll be exploring that further., Embedding Dimensions: 768\n",
      "Title: Talk 4-5, Content: Okay? And I think another thing that's very nice is that this is a global phenomenon, so this is just a sample of a five year study current, currently going on outside of the US. So I think it's important to recognize that we are thinking about this, these kind of studies all over the world. Okay, we talked a little bit about acute pain. We talked a little bit about history of ketamine. Now let's briefly talk about chronic pain. So chronic pain, which is my love. There's also consensus guidelines on chronic pain and ketamine. Again, same three societies. They also put out discussions many of the same authors, as you'll note here, since there are other people who wear these multiple hats of acute to chronic pain, and you know, ketamine IV infusions have been have been in existence for some time. When we think about what we know for sure, I mentioned being part of a CRPS center. So that is one of those areas where there is definite, moderate certainty, of evidence for ketamine infusions, and it's been shown to provide pain relief for up to 12 weeks. We can see here. Here's a sample of somebody with a CRPS syndrome of the foot. And I myself have been able to have the luxury of witnessing these patients from before and after their infusions, and then visiting us in the hospital afterwards. And you know, once you see it, you believe it. So I drink the Kool Aid for chronic pain patients for many other reasons, neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia, cancer pain, ischemic pain, migraine pain, low back pain. Unfortunately, there's still weak or no evidence really to support those uses. But I'm, I'm a personal believer. I just can't present to you that data today based on the 2018 guidelines. Okay, so what's the summary? CRPS is great, and everything else is dot, dot, dot. Well, excluding CRPS, there's no real evidence to support ketamine for intermediate or long term pain relief in those situations, there is low, low certainty evidence supporting oral ketamine as a follow up therapy after ketamine infusions. And there's also oral ketamine can be associated with high abuse potential and should be prescribed cautiously, right? So when we use it with the intranasal ketamine for breakthrough pain, it's it has some moderate evidence there, but it can be used for short term actin. So what do we really do with all of this? It's a little bit confusing, right? So we know it kind of works in the short term. We know it works for CRPS, but everything else, the waters are a little bit mucky at this point in time, even though Dr bersenko is telling you it's great, there are certain pain populations at the same time where ketamine should be considered for infusion therapy, well, for spinal cord injury, there is weak evidence supporting infusion rates ranging from 17 minutes to five hours for seven days, for short term improvements of pain, for CRPS, we talked about it that one, we feel like we can put a grade B checkmark recommendation for mixed neuropathic pain syndromes, like all the ones I mentioned right now, weak or no evidence, at least for immediate improvements of pain, grade D, unfortunately. So excluding CRPS, there's no real evidence supporting all these chronic pain and intermediate, long term improvements of pain. What are we going to do with that? Well, let's also talk about the contrary indications to continue this Debbie downward movement. Well, the contraindications are similar for acute pain and serial ketamine infusion should not be taken in patients who have active a substance abuse problem, and should be used along with universal cautions with regards to abuse, that's grade C evidence. Okay, so, and we've seen people who unfortunately have suffered the sequelae of ketamine. Okay, the other part of ketamine is it's really expensive, well, so this is from 2022 and this is a discussion from the Azra pain societies, and they talk about how expensive it is, so there's no FDA approved real indication for these infusions as a treatment modality, and the data has shown growing evidence that, you know, we don't really know exactly what we're doing here, so maybe we shouldn't pay for it. So I can tell you where I was, in one of my prior institutions, there were a lot of people there who had money, and so because of that, the numbers didn't quite matter so much, and they were able to have these seven day stays and to have these high dose treatments, and that wasn't really an issue. Many of them were lucky to have amazing results. That being said, this is not somebody, this is not a treatment that has equity, because insurance companies are not equal and this, this is not something where all patients can have access to this treatment. And I think that that's one of the things that also limits its exploration at this stage of the game. So is there any evidence for supporting. In therapeutic dose cutoff thresholds, infusion rates or higher doses. Maybe, if we give them a lot more, you know, maybe, maybe that'll make it better. Well, there's is moderate evidence to support higher dosage of ketamine over longer periods of time and more frequent in administration for chronic pain. So great. So if we can just get them the drug, give them more of it and do it more frequently, maybe we're gonna have better data there. There's similar strategies used for opiates and other analgesics with significant adverse effects, though, so it's reasonable to start with a single outpatient infusion and then kind of reassessing treatment. And so that's a great see evidence of great we can kind of titrate it up, but if we don't have access to the drug, and if it doesn't help everyone, there's, there's, there's some, there's some holes in this, in this road that we're trying to travel upon. So is there any role for oral ketamine? Okay, so IV infusions are kind of meh. We're not perfect here. What about oral or other NMDA receptor antagonisms as a follow up for treatment in rule of in lieu of repeat infusions? Well, there's low level support of oral ketamine and other NMDA receptor antagonism as a follow up therapy. There's moderate evidence to talk about intranasal and then also the oral ketamine still has significant abuse potential and street value. So you know, do we really want to be adding this to the waters of what exists in the in the common world, used with caution, and then also considering the cost and resources, it's kind of complicated, so at least we might want to consider these intranasal, oral and other treatments in lieu of serious treatment, at least that one is at least Grade B evidence, because the other stuff is so expensive and complicated to organize that maybe we can at least look at those other routes and begin to explore that more. So I'm encouraging this conversation, even outside of today's Grand Rounds. Okay, so let's just say that we have the ketamine Great. What tests should be ordered prior to an infusion of ketamine? Well, there's insufferative evidence about this as well. So pre infusion testing, we're not really sure what we need to do for the healthy person who's just starting this out, individuals at higher risk of cardiovascular events might might consider, you know, baseline ECG testing, you know, to exclude individuals with uncontrolled ischemic disease that we didn't know about and invasion in patients with baseline liver dysfunction who are alcoholics or people with chronic hepatitis or who are expected to receive very high doses of ketamine at frequent intervals, you know, basic and post infusion liver function tests should be considered, and that's grade C evidence all of this, as I mentioned in my in my clinical practice, we did do those kind of testing, but it's still grade C evidence. What training is prudent for patients who, for personnel, excuse me, who administer boluses and infusions and oversee titrations. Well, you know, ketamine doses, again, they vary, and so it's important to understand and see who these patients are and have appropriate follow up. Patients who are older might have different thresholds, so they might need different monitoring. Higher cutoffs with sub anesthetic doses may also be utilized, and so again, need to be recognized. But the basics of monitoring include hemodynamic and respiratory parameters, and they remain irrespective of the route of administration or dosing. We have to make sure these patients are okay, and of course, with that, we have to make sure there's availability of personnel and equipment for resuscitation at all times, and that is Grade C evidence. So no matter what happens, Grade A evidence is be safe and be prudent. What about what about preemptive medications for administration as rescue drugs. There's limited direct evidence support of the preemptive use of benzodiazepines, and no evidence to support antidepressant, antihistamine and anticholinergic pre medications. This is Grade C evidence. I do think, in my clinical practice, what we've always done is started the ketamine, and then, if needed, started the benzodiazepine, but there are times when they're started simultaneously, especially if they are patients that have had multiple rounds of this. There might be an expected reaction and expected dose dosing of this, and did recipe, but the recommendation preemptively is still grade C. So what constitutes a positive treatment response? Well, if we look at the refractory nature of this disease, a positive outcome was actually considered to be 30% greater or greater relief in conjunction with patient satisfaction. And as we can appreciate, you know, patient satisfaction is very hard in the chronic pain patient. On the flip side, 30% could be like a placebo effect. So what really is that? But you know, this is what the definition is discussed at in terms of duration of benefit, greater than 30 weeks as a single outpatient infusion, and greater than six weeks following an inpatient or series of infusions are considered reasonable delay., Embedding Dimensions: 768\n",
      "Title: Talk 4-6, Content: Aniations, similar to multiple guidelines for epidural injections, conservative series of infusions should not be administered by root but rather tailored to the patient response. So patients should not be treated all the same, not one size fits all, but should be, you know, really titrated to the person, and considering the long term risks of ketamine, limiting to no more than six to 12 treatments per year is reasonable, so I think deviations can be made as well many times. We didn't do it that way necessarily, but that's grade C evidence and also still under discussion. Okay, so another thing that kind of gets exciting is all of these different receptors. So both in acute pain and chronic pain, there are lots of prevalence of rates of surgery and acute pain and post traumatic pain. And so I think there's a lot of room for further studies in this area. I want to make sure we have enough time for questions. This is a pain faculty talking about the use of non cancer pain outside of the US, and so again, it's being studied across the world. Reminder that there are many different sample infusion rates, and this is another one from halfway across the world. This is from Dr Cohen, who is not too far from us and recently moved institutions talking about his sample rates. And then I briefly want to touch on depression and make sure we have enough time for questions. I promised myself and promised at my my colleagues, that I would be on time and I will be so. I think this is an exciting subtopic, just to whet your appetite, remember that anybody who has depression, 1/3 of patients with chronic pain have concurrent psychiatric comorbidities such as depression, and so you wonder how much of these pathways overlap each other. There are clinical trials that have talked about ketamine for depression, for prevention of PTSD, the primary effects were thought to be part of the NMDA receptor, but actually may be part of these other glutamate pathways. May be affecting the gabapentinoid pathways, and there's a lot of beginnings of discussions on this topic. And if you're interested, I highly recommend there's a DR Huberman who is from Stanford in California, and he does these wonderful podcast type YouTube videos discussing these topics. He's an excellent speaker. And if you have a fascination in this specific subtype area, I highly recommend him. I don't know him, but I think his videos are great. So you know, what's interesting about ketamine for depression is, again, we're the electricians of the human body. We're playing with the NMDA receptor. We're trying to change that glutamate surge there, mother, there are a number of things that are modulated in the brain, and then there's an increase of gabapentin, GABA B levels. And so isn't it exciting that there can be this cascade of effects that have been noted to have serial surges and might actually be able to affect this state as well for post operative depression, it's been controversial, to be fair, the studies are still not 100% I clearly drink the Kool Aid. But please, let me be fair. In my conversation in 2023 there was a meta analysis of 15 studies that discussed perioperative ketamine, reducing post operative depression, increased risks, such as nausea, vomiting, hallucinations. In a double randomized blind trial, ketamine was given to 210, patients undergoing C section with spinal anesthesia, and the ketamine did not reduce their depression at one, two or four weeks post operatively. And you know, post postpartum depression is something that exists in 2021 ketamine was given to neurosurgery patients undergoing intracranial tumor resection, and this trial did show that ketamine could reveal moderate to severe depression in neurosurgical patients. So you know, we're kind of poking in the waters in this area, but I think there's a lot of room to keep digging. So these are a few references, and then, most importantly, this is my family. And so I leave you with the thoughts of, may you always have a purpose to do better as a person and as a professional, for your vocation, your ethics and your life choices, and this is the reason I do what I do. And with that, thank you very much. I'm on time, gentlemen and ladies, I have five minutes left for question. I'm going to stop sharing my slides., Embedding Dimensions: 768\n",
      "Title: Talk 5-1, Content: I'd like to give a brief introduction for our esteemed speaker, Jonathan Jerry, I had the opportunity of reading some of his really great work, and some of our colleagues have read it in a number of across a number of settings. He's the science communicator with the McGill office for science and society dedicated to separating sense from nonsense on his scientific stage. He has a master's degree in molecular biology, and he brings his experience in cancer research, human genetics, rehab research and forensic biology to the work he does for the public. He was a creator, writer and a host of the YouTube show cracked science, which used the late night deep dive format to debunk pseudoscience and denounce bad science. With cardiologist Dr Christopher levos, he co host the award winning medical podcast the body of evidence, which aims to contextualize findings in the realm of health research and answer the public's most pressing questions about the biomedical sciences, while also being rather funny and entertaining, he talks about science every Friday on CTV Montreal news, and is regularly interviewed in both English and French languages. As we all know, the area of pain has been challenged, and this is an area where we need much greater focus on issues of science, as opposed to some of the challenges that occur in our field. So Jonathan, thank you again for doing this. Turn it over to you, and we'll welcome questions at the end., Embedding Dimensions: 768\n",
      "Title: Talk 5-2, Content: Thank you very much for the introduction, and thank you again for the invitation. I'm very, very happy to be here this morning. I'll be sharing my There we go. Share my screen. I hope you can all something a little bit different, I guess, for your for your rounds, compared to the usual stuff. As was mentioned, I work at the McGill office for science and society at McGill University in Montreal, Canada. We're fairly unique in that our job is not to do PR for the university. We're not doing research, but we are answering the public's question about science, about what is good science, what is bad science, what is outright fake science. And of course, this pandemic has been has kept us very, very busy. So I want to talk about what, how to debunk this misinformation according to the best scientific evidence that we have right now. And I will begin by giving my little disclosure here. So I've ironically received a speaking fee from my own university to give a version of this talk to a different department through the the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences. So, to begin, is world on fire. And I'm asking this question because you, I'm sure you've seen this. This was from from the very beginning of the pandemic, burning cell towers out of baseless fear they spread the virus. There was this notion among certain members of the community that COVID 19 was not being caused by a virus, but rather was a consequence of 5g telecommunications technology that was being turned on all over the world, and that was that was having harmful effects on the human body. In fact, it got to the point where some of these towers were being burned down. This is from my quote, unquote, neighborhood here. Quebec. So this was not a 5g tower. Unfortunately. I mean, most of them were not even, did not even have 5g technology, but they just, they were telecommunications towers, and some activists decided to set them on fire to protect the rest of the world. You might have seen this tweet from the Food and Drug Administration in your country. So you are not a horse. You're not a cow. Seriously, y'all stop it. So they actually tweeted this out, out of their official account. This was, of course, because of ivermectin, which is an anti parasitic drug which has been adopted by some people as a as a perfect cure and prophylactic against covid 19, even though there's no good evidence behind that, and I will come back to ivermectin later on. During my talk in India, some people were being told to apply cow excrements on their head and on their body as a remedy against covid. 19, there was also a mention of cow urine. This got exported to the United States, where some anti vaxxers were telling their supporters that the new the new cure for covid was urine therapy. So please drink your urine and everything will be okay. In fact, if you go to Wikipedia, there's a whole page just on covid, 19 misinformation. And this is a table of contents, and this, with this screenshot, was actually taken a year ago, so I'm sure it's actually gotten worse since then. So this is how you might be feeling right now. What do I do with all of this? Is the world on fire. There's nothing. Nobody trusts science anymore. Everything is going downhill. So that was the first part of the talk. Actually, it's not as bad as it looks. And you may be wondering, okay, but I want to push back against this stuff, but I don't know how, and there are things that I worry about, so that's what I want to to address here. First of all, a few definitions, which I think will be very useful when we talk about misinformation. It is false information that is not known to be false by the sharer. So for example, if there's an article about the alleged toxicity of a vaccine that is false, it's not accurate, but the person sharing it believes it to be true, they are sharing misinformation, and this is often conflated in the media with disinformation. And disinformation is false information that is known to be false by the person sharing it, who may even have fabricated it. This is also known as a lie. You may remember when the phrase fake news was first coined, it was to describe these websites that were creating out of whole cloth, fake stories about Hillary Clinton, about Donald Trump in order to swing an election, in order to make some money from ad revenue from the traffic that they were getting, or just to have fun. So that is disinformation. And for your information, there's mal information as well, which I will not be talking about today, but this is true information, but that is shared deliberately to cause harm. Classic example is revenge porn. So a sex video is film. It is accurate, but it is then being shared in order to harm the people in it. So that is mal information. The last definition that I want to go over is pseudoscience, which is something that I tackle all the time in the work that I do. So pseudoscience is a collection of related beliefs about the world that are mistakenly regarded as being based on a scientific method, whereas having the status that science, that scientific truths now have it translates into fake science. So it looks like science, but it's not actually science. And unfortunately, there is no clear demarcation between science and pseudoscience. It is more of a spectrum. There are things that are very clearly scientific, there are things that are very clearly pseudo scientific. And there's a gray zone in between where some some interesting notions might be proto scientific. There might be a science in the works. It's not clear. So it's not always easy to figure out if something is a pseudoscience or isn't, because there is no clear line between them. , Embedding Dimensions: 768\n",
      "Title: Talk 5-3, Content: One thing that is certain is that there is a lot of pseudoscience out there, and I've just placed a few, a few illustrations of that on the screen right now, there's a lot of stuff that somebody who doesn't know much about it may look scientific on its surface. They have scientific studies behind them. They are being sold with this patina of scientific legitimacy around them, but they are not actually scientific. And when it comes to addressing these in the public square and sort of pushing back against this misinformation and the pseudoscience you might be wondering about, for example, the backfire effect. And this came out in 2010 I believe the screenshot is from an earlier version of the manuscript. And this sent a chill down in science communication circles. This was a study done by Brendan Nyhan, Jason Reifler, and as they explained in their abstract, they were providing people with information that was false, and they were then issuing a correction in this experimental setting. And what they. Discovered is that there were some examples of what they called a backfire effect, so corrections actually increased misperceptions among the group in question. So you were trying to address misinformation, and it actually made things worse. The person doubled down and believed in it even more. And so for a while, we were all very depressed and scared because we thought, well, I guess we can't address these issues at all, because otherwise we're just going to make things worse. However, there have been many studies since on this alleged backfire effect that have shown that the original study would be detected was done in a highly specific context, and the backfire effect, if it even exists, is actually quite rare, so it's not something that we particularly need to worry about. Yes, there are people who will double down, but that is not the majority of people. Another issue that you might have in mind is, yes, but you know, if I, if I debunk this misinformation online, for example, if I write about this on Facebook and Twitter, I end up repeating it. And isn't it true that just repeating misinformation will make it appear, will just create this link in people's minds? Right? So if we're talking about the the false link between vaccines and autism, some people write a vaccines cause autism, and then you write, you know, an article saying that vaccines do not cause autism, and there's another headline saying there's no relationship between vaccines and autism, and there's all this noise about vaccines and autism. The idea is that people will remember hearing about vaccines and hearing about autism in close proximity to each other. So maybe there's a link within those two things. I'm not quite sure. I don't quite remember. So that is, it's a genuine concern, and that is why, for example, it's not a good idea to shine a spotlight on a tiny myth that no one has ever heard of, something that could be harmful, but that has gotten no traction whatsoever, because then you're just amplifying this correlation in people's minds that it's actually not true. It's also a good idea. Why? For example, giving a title to a piece that is, for example, is 5g causing COVID 19? Not a good idea. A lot of people just read the headline. They don't read the article. And if they keep seeing these questions being asked in the media about 5g possibly causing COVID 19, they might infer that, indeed, there is a link between 5g and COVID 19. So it is better to title our articles. For example, 5g does not cause COVID 19, and here's why. So this idea spreading concern, this is concern for spreading a link that is false but that will ring true in people's minds. It is important to keep that in mind. But the evidence so far is very far from definitive, and the evidence that we do have suggests that it doesn't often happen. So once again, genuine concern, but not something that we need to, you know, really panic about. There's an interesting model to try and minimize this possibility. There's no good evidence that this model works any better than any other way of going about this. But I just find it interesting, something that you may want to adopt if this is something that you feel strongly about. And this is the sandwich model, which is that, before you address a myth, you flag it as such, right? So it's the bread, you know, condiments and meat, and then the bread again, type of model. So the first, the first layer of bread is okay. What I'm about to tell you is not true, but it's been spreading around the internet, so we need to address this. Then you talk about what this myth is. There's this myth going around that causes COVID 19. Here's why it's not true. And then at the end, you repeat that this was done. This was not true. This was a myth. Do not believe this as a way of, sort of priming the brain to expect something that is not true. Again, not great evidence behind this, but an interesting model to to potentially try and try out, speaking of the literature on good practices when it comes to debunking misinformation, is still emerging. So what that means is that you will find contradictory results. You will find highly contrived situations where researchers bring in undergraduate students, of course, into their lab, and they try to recreate what social media is like using screenshots and what have you. And so it's not quite the same thing as the real world. There's this issue of playing catch up with the internet, which is that by the time a study gets funded and gets underway, they might be testing YouTube, but now all the kids are on Tiktok, right? So there is this, this delay effect because of that, all of that, all of those very important caveats being said. There are themes that do emerge from the literature that can guide us when we want to and have to address misinformation about health and pseudo scientific notions, and it is quite reassuring. So here we go. Very importantly, use facts. Facts often do work. You may think that nobody believes in facts anymore, in a post fact environment that is not. Quite true facts often do work to counteract misinformation, and they especially work if you can provide better explanations, because the brain and pores a vacuum. So for example, I can imagine a situation in which a patient brings up some kind of alternative medical intervention that they've been undertaking, and they said that it worked for them. And you might want to say, well, oh, that thing that you took, yeah, that doesn't work, that that's pure quackery. And then you end the conversation there, and you move on, and the patient thinks, well, but how else to explain that? I got better. So they were not feeling well. They did the thing, and then they felt better. And so they assumed that there's a causal relationship between those two things. And so you can imagine that in their head, they have a table, and you just kicked the leg off of the table, and now the table is unstable, because now they they got better, but they don't have an explanation for how they got better. And if you don't fill that void with a better leg, the brain will go back to its original explanation. So in this particular case, you may want to talk about the placebo response, which is often the answer to this question of, How did alternative medicine work? In this particular case, there are things like self limiting conditions, for example, the flu, if it doesn't kill you, doesn't last forever. Immune system kicks in, and so as you're feeling really bad from the flu, you reach out for whatever you can find, and then you get better. It's not because the thing that you took made you better, but just because it's a self limiting condition, your immune system kicked in. There's a there's the very important process of regression to the mean, which is a statistical artifact, which is that, for example, in the case of chronic pain, which I'm sure you're much more familiar with than I am, there are fluctuations in the severity of the pain, and sometimes there are flare ups. And so you go above the average value of pain intensity, and during one of those flare ups, you know, I can, I can imagine, you, you would want to reach out for anything that you can find out of despair, and then your pain goes back down to its average value, because it basically has to, I mean, unless it's a much worsening condition, you're going to go back to the mean value for statistical regression, reasons of regression, so it will appear as if this intervention work, whereas, in fact, it was just a statistical artifact. And then there's the issue of multiple treatments, which is that if somebody tells you that they got cured of their cancer because of homeopathy, they may not be telling you that they also have chemotherapy and surgery, right? So it's easy to sort of focus on one of the interventions and dismiss the other ones, when they're the ones that actually had had an actual impact., Embedding Dimensions: 768\n",
      "Title: Talk 5-4, Content: I'll be referring to a few case studies along the way to illustrate these, these examples, and the first one I want to mention is the one which was flagged to me when I was invited to give this talk, because I've written about Havana syndrome, and it's very interesting, this idea of needing an explanation for a phenomenon and reaching for anything that you can find. So I'm sure many of you are familiar with this, but in case, in case you're not so late, 2016 early. 2017 members of the American embassy in Havana, Cuba, they start to report these debilitating symptoms, strange occurrences. Many describe it as a sort of unidirectional, incapacitating sound, very intense. There's this pressure inside the ear. Some people experience vertigo, nausea. Then we get into sort of the mid range side effects that start to start to happen, difficulty concentrating, memory problems, sleep disturbances. Then we get members of the Canadian embassy in Cuba that are reporting similar occurrences. And then it starts to spread all over the world. And we get these reports from Australia, from China, from all over the world, just outside the White House. So what is causing this? In fact, you may remember your own vice president, Kamala Harris, her trip to Vietnam was delayed because they had heard that there was a possible Havana syndrome case there, and they didn't know what was causing it. And so as so as not to put her at risk, they delayed her flight. So again, the brain abhors a vacuum. It looks for an explanation, and when easy answers were unsatisfying, it turned to more eccentric explanations. So some people brought up the idea of a poison. Could it be that these diplomats were being poisoned through the food that they ate, the air that they breathe? But the problem is that many people in their entourage would also eat the same food and breathe the same air, and they didn't get sick. There was a hypothesis of neurotoxins and the pesticides used to combat Zika all over Cuba, but there were no native Cubans that reported being sick in that way. So it's kind of bizarre that only the American diplomats were targeted in this way, and then they turn into these experimental weapons. Could it be an infrasound weapon? So a sound that is so low in pitch you can't actually hear it, but it would have an effect on the body. The most infamous type of Infrasound is the brown note. This idea that at a certain pitch, when when the body feels it, it provokes involuntary defecation. But the brown note is a myth. It was. It was actually tested on Mythbusters. It doesn't have. In Ultra could it be an ultrasound weapon, a very high pitched sound, but these waves need very close contact to propagate, and they're easily blocked by walls. And so if you're trying to attack an embassy from the outside, you know you have, you have a truck there parked, and you've got your your ultrasound weapon, those ultrasounds are not going to penetrate those walls, and it would also have massive energy needs. So where do you hide the generator that is needed to make this work? Then it was this idea of a microwave weapon. As far as I can tell, these experimental weapons so far, they could be quite unreliable. They're also in need of these imposing generators, and they would also mess with the electronics in the diplomats house, which and they were not affected. But then they brought in the fray effect, which was reported. It's an interesting effect whereby you can hear microwaves. Or you wouldn't think that you could hear microwaves, but in certain circumstances, you can. And so they thought, well, there you go. It was a microwave weapon. They reported hearing a sound. It must be through the fray effect, but the Frey fact requires near silence to perceive it, and the sound was very, very loud. It turns out that somebody managed to record the sounds. It wasn't just happening in somebody's ears. There was an actual sound, and it was identified as being made by crickets, a very specific species of crickets. And they're actually they're very, very loud. So that seems to be what the sound, the mysterious sound, was. And the best explanation that I could find for what happened is mass psychogenic illness. And if you want to dig deeper into this, it's a very good book about this by Robert Baylor, Robert Bartholomew. It's called Havana syndrome, mass psychogenic illness. And the real story behind the embassy mystery and hysteria. And there are many historical examples of these kinds of mass psychogenic illnesses, where these non specific symptoms, they get interpreted in light of some, you know, massive amount of stress that is being felt by, for example, diplomats in a country that doesn't really like them, and that can then spread to other people, who then also start to experience insomnia and vertigo and these episodes of stress, and it turns into something, even though there was nothing really there. Again, we don't really know what is going on with Havana syndrome. I'm not an expert on Havana syndrome, but that seems to be the most plausible explanation that we have at the moment. So going back to how to debunk misinformation, I mentioned that facts are very useful. We shouldn't forget about facts. But sometimes facts are not enough, because sometimes somebody's some belief becomes part of somebody's identity. And so when you attack a particular belief, when you attack a bit of misinformation, when you attack a specific type of pseudoscience, these people feel attacked themselves, and it can be very hard to have productive conversations with people like that who strongly identify with being an anti Vaxxer. For example, there are a few tips that have emerged. One of them is to start with values. Too often these conversations are very antagonistic, and you're being perceived as the enemy, but if you make the other person realize that you actually share the same values when it comes to these things and when it comes to vaccines. For example, I I'm very pro vaccine, but I want vaccines that are safe. I want vaccines that are effective. I want vaccines that are affordable. And same thing with the food supply. I want food that is that is affordable. I want food that is nutritious, that is tasty, and so when you begin by voicing what your values are on this and the align with the values of the person that you're speaking to, all of a sudden you're not speaking across from each other, but you're speaking next to each other. You are on the same side of the aisle, and you're both looking at the evidence, and that can help kind of diffuse the antagonism that can otherwise occur. Another bit of, a little bit of a tip there is to be empathetic, which, which can be hard. And of course, throughout the pandemic, everybody's patience has has gotten very, very down to the wire. But being empathetic can really help and understanding that somebody is very anxious and very stressed about something they believe in that, you know, is inaccurate. I mean, it doesn't change the fact that they are stressed about this, and they have real anxiety over this. And to be empathetic and to voice that empathy can also be conducive to a good a good conversation. It's also important to remember that you may not be able to change somebody's mind on the spot, but you can act as a pebble in their shoe, which means that this conversation that they've had with you might stick with them, and just like a pebble in your shoe, they're going to walk around and it's going to annoy them. It's going to keep they won't be able to flush it out of their out of their brain, and they will keep going back to it. And maybe a few months down the road, they'll be ready for a second conversation, or maybe they'll be ready to have a conversation with somebody else about this topic. So we shouldn't dismiss the importance of having conversations that do not resolve in somebody suddenly changing their mind about an important belief. Sometimes these things take time, but your conversation, if it is empathetic and if it's a good. Conversation can actually act as a pebble in their shoe., Embedding Dimensions: 768\n",
      "Title: Talk 5-5, Content: But speaking of what happens when identity takes over, I mentioned ivermectin earlier, and I've written about ivermectin as well. So as I'm sure you know, it's a very useful drug for the treatment of certain infections in humans and animals. Then came COVID 19, and of course, everybody was trying to find any kind of treatment for COVID 19, there are many, many, many molecules that have antiviral activity in the lab, meaning that when you put them in a culture flask, you know, with cells and culture that are infected with a virus, that molecule will prevent the virus from making copies of itself. That's what an antiviral is. But just because something has antiviral properties in vitro doesn't mean that it will actually translate into a proper antiviral that is useful in humans. So there was this in vitro study done in African Green Monkey kidney cells with SARS cov two using high doses of ivermectin, much higher than what is typically given to humans. And it showed promising results in that it was, it was, it had antiviral activity against SARS, COVID, two. Then there were a few studies done in humans. There was a meta analysis of these studies showing a positive effect. But unfortunately, that meta analysis was skewed by one big study, and it looks like that study never happened. And if you're interested in hearing more about this on the podcast, and I co host the body of evidence, I actually interviewed Gideon Meyer, which Katz and Jack Lawrence, who's Jack Lawrence is a student in England who actually first came across evidence of scientific fraud in the ivermectin COVID 19 literature. And that kind of snowballed into an investigation. And there have been many fraudulent studies about using ivermectin, studies that could not have happened as described, studies where you can clearly see entire sections of the data set that's been copied and pasted from one patient to the next. And unfortunately, there's no good evidence right now that ivermectin has a fantastic ability to either cure or to prevent COVID 19. But as you're aware of, ivermectin became politicized, and it started to inform people's sense of identity, and with those people, facts were not enough. You couldn't just say, well, there's no good evidence ivermectin works. These papers look like they're fraudulent. It wasn't working. There was it was being deflected, and they felt personally attacked. And some of those people were anti Big Pharma, and ivermectin is all patent, so pharmaceutical companies can't profit too much from it, and that's something that these people like. And so their reasoning is, well, it must work because they can't profit from it. Some people were very conspiracy minded, which is that, okay, so it works, but pharma doesn't want you to know that it works, because they can't profit too much, so they're hiding the truth from you. So that played into this conspiracy narrative that ivermectin is a great treatment, but they're hiding it from you because they want to profit off of newer drugs that are still unpacked. Then there were the COVID minimizers who didn't like the public health measures and saw no need for them. And ivermectin became a great justification for that. See, you just take this drug that is well known, well tolerated, you take it prophylactically, and you'll be fine. And then you have the non conformists, which is people who don't believe in the scientific consensus on any issue, they think that the consensus is bought for by pharma money, or it's made of idiots, and they like to listen to the truth telling Mavericks, the robes, the fringe views, and those fringe scientists were endorsing ivermectin, therefore they must be onto something, and the scientific consensus is wrong. So this whole ivermectin narrative basically resonated with the identity of a lot of people who had those kinds of values, and in those cases, facts are just not enough. Coming back to how to debunk pseudoscience you want to use trustworthy and independent sources. So some people have a pathological distrust of governments and corporations. I have what I believe to be a healthy distrust of governments and corporations, but for some people, it is pathological. They distrust any consensus that emerges from them. They think that governments are completely paid for by corporations, and corporations are only interested in making money. And so they will keep telling you, follow the money. Follow my see is follow the money. And you'll see that this whole line of reasoning is corrupted. Of course, they never follow the money when it comes to the people that they idolize. But they only they all. They always do it for the people that they disagree with. All that to say that, if possible, it is better to share information. Of course, some sources that do not have a clear agenda. If Pfizer has written a brief saying that, you know, we at Pfizer say that our vaccine is 93% effective against COVID, trust us. They may be right. They may not be lying. But of course, if you're using that as you know, as evidence, a lot of people will look at this very suspicious. Well, of course, Pfizer would say that they want to sell their vaccines. There are sources that do not have this, you know, clear money making agenda, for example, I am tangentially associated with the science up first initiative in Canada, which is a group of independent scientists and physicians and healthcare professionals who get together and who, and we have these campaigns on social media to tell the public specifically about COVID. 19 right now. What do we know about COVID? What do we know about the vaccines? What are some of the misinformation that you might have heard and we're not funded by by pharma, so those kinds of sources of information do not have this clear agenda are better if you're trying to convince somebody, obviously, and also, very interestingly enough, despite what your Facebook feed and watching CNN really do to believe most people do still trust public health agencies and independent scientists, especially in times of crisis. That may be changing a little bit in the United States right now, I'm not sure, but based on the data that we have so far, sometimes the fringe voices are very loud, and it makes it appear as though they are much more popular than they are. But actually, good public health agency information can still change minds. Another thing, which is, you know, something that I've had to learn and and also kind of unlearn is, is don't write academically. So if you are addressing these issues for the public, you want to avoid technical terms unless they are necessary, and you want to explain the technical terms that are necessary. We go to university. We are taught how to write in this very dry, academic, objective, detached kind of way we're using big technical words. But when it comes to talking to the public about these issues, we have to unlearn all of that and right in a way that is much more accessible. It's important to keep in mind that most people have no idea what neurons look like. Most people don't know where DNA is in our body. They've heard of DNA. They know it's it's part of us as our blueprint, but they don't really know where it is. So it's easy for us to fall for the curse of knowledge, which is that you don't realize that what you know is not known by the people you're speaking to. You just assume that, of course, everybody knows about this stuff. You don't even question it. But actually, you kind of have to take a step back and go, Wait a second. Do they do they know this thing that I take for granted? Maybe not, which is why it is important to use analogies and metaphors and other figures of speech as needed. A very helpful tip is to ask yourself, would my grandma understand this unless, of course, she was or is a doctor or a biochemist or something to that regard, but then pick a different relative. But this idea of having a reader in mind, right? Somebody who does not have your university studies, would they be able to understand this? I think the most important tip in science communication circles is always to use storytelling, and this is something we don't do enough of, because misinformation itself often spreads virally because it is tied to a personal story. I had the misfortune of watching this thing called Vax to the people's truth. It pretends to be a documentary about vaccine related adverse events, specifically the vaccine autism, false connection. It's a piece of propaganda and but it's a very convincing piece of propaganda, because this is what it looks like. It is essentially a series of interviews, often with moms with their child, and they almost all follow the same structure, so they talk about how their child was wonderful at first, and there's soft acoustic guitar music in the background, and you see pictures of the baby smiling, and then they got the MMR shot, and they were never the same. And then the mom starts crying. And there's an accumulation of these anecdotes, these testimonials, for an hour and a half. And I can very easily imagine that if I'm a new parent, or if I'm a parent to be and I see this, I'm going to start getting very nervous, because now there's an accumulation of anecdotes, and I'm a little bit scared now, am I? Am I being lied to? Is there something wrong with this thing? And of course, then you enter the anti vaccination infrastructure, which is very, very well funded, and which might scare you away from giving your child very safe and effective childhood immunizations. So the reason that this works is that our brain is wired to respond to stories. We are storytelling species, and we can also use that on our side, because a narrative can be used to convey science in a compelling and memorable way, or also as a hook to guide the audience into the scientific data., Embedding Dimensions: 768\n",
      "Title: Talk 5-6, Content: For example, I just previously said, random you, if you, if you ever, if you've ever read a piece in the newspaper about a health, some kind of health story, it almost always starts with an anecdote. And this is a piece I found in The Globe and Mail. And it goes like this, like a lot of people when Toronto Life Coach and Speaker Ryan. Carry is about to give a speech in front of a crowd. She reminds yourself to breathe, and there's a quote, and then we and then we go into breath work. Is there evidence behind breath work or not? So journalists are taught to do do, to do this all the time, because it works. It helps. It helps the reader focus on a person that they can relate to, and you follow their journey, as opposed to just starting with facts and starting with with numbers, which which are a little bit on the dry side. Um, another tip is to point out fallacies and biases responsibly. So pseudoscience often appears believable because of biases in our thinking. So ways in which our thinking is skewed away from the truth away from being reliable in ways that are very predictable. And then there are errors in logic that are known as fallacies, that appear to be logical, but they're not, but they're very convincing. And I'll give you just a handful of examples. When it comes to health related pseudoscience, the most popular ones are the appeal to nature, right? So it's natural, therefore it must be good for us, it must be safe for us. There's a reason why we're spending so much money removing asbestos from our buildings. Asbestos is not safe for us, but there is this very deep wiring in the brain that tells us that if something is natural, it must be beneficial to us and it must be safe in its consumption. And if it is synthetic or artificial, then it's not good for us and it is not safe for us. That is a bias. It's a cognitive bias. It is not true, and it can be weaponized as a logical fallacy. And you see this all over the wellness space. So it can be and can be useful to point this out. Like to give examples of things that are natural, that are not good for us, and things are synthetic, which are perfectly safe for us. You know, the dose makes the poison. We have to test these things to know how safe they are, and other biases. The appeal to antiquity, which is, oh, well, this day, it's been used for 200 years because it works. Otherwise, why would we still be using it? Of course, I don't need to tell you that for centuries, bloodletting and leeches were used in medicine because there was nothing else, and apart from a few very specific applications, now, medicine has moved on. So just because something has been used for a very long time does not actually imply that it is working. And the biggest bias, I think, the most important bias in our brain, is the confirmation bias. And this something that we are all we can all fall for. We have to be aware of this, and it is starting from a conclusion that we like and working backwards. So you start by saying, I believe that this thing works. So now I will go on either on the internet, I will find papers that support my view, and I will dismiss those that disagree with me, and then I will convince myself that I've done my own research, and I've been very objective about this, but you know, it just so happens that my conclusion was proven true. And again, we're all susceptible to this, and this is something that we have to struggle to to, to exert ourselves from emphasize the consensus, if there is one, obviously, when COVID 19 started, there was no consensus, because we didn't know anything about this. New viruses don't come with instructions manuals, but eventually there's enough evidence from different lines of inquiry that converge in the same direction, and you get a consensus. And very often, what happens in pseudoscience is that the mainstream view and the fringe view are put on equal footing. They're given this false balance. And if the public doesn't know that one of them is a consensus and one of them is a fringe view, they will think that there's a genuine uncertainty, there's a genuine debate happening in the scientific community. So sometimes can be very helpful to remind people that, no, no, the weight of the evidence is here. We know this for pretty much for a fact, and that person over there has a very, very fringe view. They're just very, very loud. And that can put things back into perspective on social media. It can be very useful to remind people to slow down. There is evidence that people often share misinformation, not because they want to cause harm. I mean, it's misinformation. They don't know that it's false, simply because their attention is focused on factors other than accuracy, they don't stop to ask themselves, is this true? And so by reminding them to pay attention, to slow down and to ask themselves, if this information is active before sharing, we can reduce the spread of misinformation. You know, it's the social media companies have all these incentives built into their system to get us to react very quickly in anger and disgust and to share. But you have to ask yourself, you know, will somebody die if I don't share this right now, if I take the time, I don't have time now I'm at work. I don't have time to read the article. I will read it tonight, and then I'll figure out if this thing looks legit or not. So nobody's going to die if you don't share that particular tweet. So if we all slow down, we could contribute to slowing down the spread of misinformation and Fauci. Finally, avoid shaming, be empathetic. You know, it's important to remind all of us that ordinary people who fall for misinformation do not deserve scorn. There are people that are generating disinformation and that are profiting mightily from it, and I do believe that these people deserve scorn, but the people who just fall for this, they do not deserve scorn, because when was the last time that you change your mind after being called an idiot? Right? It doesn't. It doesn't really work. I think there's value in and this is especially in one on one conversations in the real world. But there's a lot of a lot to gain from listening to these people first, even when you know what they're about to say, you know that this is misinformation. Listening first is good. It establishes a relationship of trust. It means that you care, and acknowledging the validity of their worries is important as well. I understand that you were stressed out about this. I would be too. You may want to concede the parts that they got right. You know, I understand that you are worried about the pharmaceutical industry and the and the and the influence that it can have on on healthcare professionals. I worry about this as well, and then present active evidence. But despite that, you know here's why, why we know that the covid 19 vaccines are safe and effective. Here are the studies that have been done, but starting by listening, by acknowledging the validity of their worries, conceding the parts of the gut right, and then presenting the evidence. And then you can use your personal experience as an example, if it exists, if it is about discussing childhood vaccinations with with a parent who is hesitant. And you have kids and you have vaccinated them, talking about bad examples, and, you know, I have three kids, and they're fully vaccinated, and nothing wrong you know happened with them. These vaccines have been very, very well tested using that again, that storytelling, personal experience, it can really make a difference that being said, you may be very, very compassionate and still draw the ire of people who feel offended nonetheless. And that brings us to our last case study for today, which is multiple chemical sensitivity. So for those of you who don't know multiple chemical sensitivity, which goes under by different names as well, it is a diagnosis or a syndrome of non specific symptoms that can affect seemingly every organ system in the body. The culprit that is being blamed within this diagnosis is small concentrations of chemicals that the rest of us tolerate. It can be perfumes, can be air fresheners, paint, scented products, etc. And so the question becomes, how are these chemicals causing harm? Are they causing harm? What I found very interesting recently is that the government here in Quebec noticed that there were many more diagnoses of multiple chemical sensitivity than were expected given the size of our population. And so in order, in order to address this the needs of this population, our government tasked our public health agency in Quebec, the inspq, to look deeply into the literature to see what was known about NCS. And so the inspq spent almost a decade looking at this whole literature and then writing a very long report about this. And then I wrote about this for for McGill. And just to give you an idea of how massive this endeavor was, this is an 840 page report started in 2012 an exploratory look into literature, then in depth searches in 2013 of 28 different research databases, plus additional search engines and platforms. Then an additional search in 2019 to see what had been published since. So they analyzed a total of 4028 documents, most of which were peer reviewed scientific papers., Embedding Dimensions: 768\n",
      "Title: Talk 5-7, Content: And they looked at the data behind several hypotheses that were brought up to try and explain multiple chemical sensitivity. Is it genetics? Is it neurobiology? Is it the immune system? Is that oxidative homeostasis is disrupted? Is there neuroinflammation? Is there a change in the olfactory system, or is it psychogenic, and what they boil it down to is that the best answer that we have right now is chronic anxiety being a causal factor for MCs. And as they write, you know, the authors of this report rebut the hypothesis that there is a relationship between MCS and the toxicity of chemicals present at normal concentrations. Nonetheless, what is being experienced is the symptoms themselves are very real, and there are real repercussions to that. It is a real health issue, and they say that there should be Centers of Expertise specializing in MCs that should be set up, but that, as far as we can tell right now, this is not being caused by the toxicity of these chemicals at normal concentrations. I wrote about this for our office at McGill. I felt like my piece had a lot of compassion in it. I specifically said nobody's calling these people crazy. That's not what is going on. Despite that, this was picked up by people in the community who have MCs, and I got an avalanche of emails people who were dearly offended by what I had written. I got the accusation that I had based this entire article on a single study, because they didn't understand the difference between a report of 4000 studies and a study. I was accused of showing no compassion for very real symptoms, even though there were multiple sentences there where I showed genuine compassion for these people, I was accused of committing an ethical violation, and that this article should be retracted and I needed to publicly apologize. Somebody told me that they were told that a course of antibiotics had disabled the two toxin removing chromosomes that they had, which is why they had MCs, what they had been told I studied human genetics. I know that this is not true. We don't have chromosomes that are just dedicated to removing toxins from the body, but this is what they had been told, probably by a naturopath. And so it was, it was very, very frustrating to have written, you know, to have this report that comes from a good place of the government wanting to act and do something. This is the answer that the literature gives us. I report on them with a lot of compassion, and despite that, because it's not the conclusion that they were looking for, these people were very angry. So that can still happen. So finally, for your sanity, I want to bring you my most important slide. If you are interested in tackling misinformation and pseudoscience. And this is the slide, the people who are strongly against you, they can hardly be reached. And I don't write for these people, right? I don't think that it's a good investment of time and energy and mental stress to try and reach the people who are very, very very strongly against me. The people who are strongly on my side, they can amplify my voice. They can share what I do my work, with people that I couldn't reach otherwise. But I write for the people in the middle, the people who are undecided, the people who are on the fence, who are confused. They've heard one thing, they've heard the other thing. They don't know what's true, and that is my target audience, so I would strongly invite you to not be this person who is not coming to bed because someone is wrong on the internet, you can't change. You know, you can get rid of irrationality and scientific illiteracy on the entire planet, but you can certainly make a difference with people who are genuinely and understandably confused. So here are some links for you if you want to take a screenshot of this slide before I stop sharing my screen and we go to the Q and A. I put up first here some good resources on debunking and science communication. I mentioned the science of first initiative. There are some podcasts that I recommend, some YouTube channels. Also, you don't have to reinvent the wheel. You can share content that already exists. All the case studies that I mentioned are things that I've written about from McGill. So you can search for these on our website at McGill, dot C, slash, OSS, and if you want to find me in my work, if you want to reach out at me on Twitter or via email, all of that is written there. So again, thank you very much for your attention. I hope that this was useful and educational, and I will be answering questions now., Embedding Dimensions: 768\n"

      "Content: Now, what are the ethical framework that we should consider, consider when we think about shared decision making in our space. You've, you know, we've all seen what the pillars of bioethics in a pain space could look like. Now, what are the frameworks that we can consider to truly, truly start changing the dialog and and I truly like this article written by dinof at the British Journal of anesthesia, of anesthesia. And it's the idea of taking advantage of understanding Chaldeans framework and codigens framework is really straightforward, and it says that the purpose of of dialog, if it's centered around human flourishing, medical treatment or diagnosis, goals of care, values and benefits, and really understanding the concepts of health that one can actually aspire or, more importantly, achieve a better healthcare outcome in in a pain space and and there, you know, there's several ways to understand this. For from a medical test component, it comes down to how you interact with the patient regarding their imaging. From a human flourishing component, it goes back to how you interact with the patient, about their well being. Goals of care. It goes back to how you interact with the patient regarding what does the patient want? What what is this autonomous to them? Or am I? Am I Am I pushing this decision on the patient values and belief? Very similar concepts of health. Again, very similar. Are you communicating with the patient, whether it's through visual aids, whether it's through AI, whether it's through a structural a mental structure that ensures that the patient is a part of the care. Are you using this five components to achieve that? And and collagen framework suggests that if you can incorporate some of this five framework into your daily practice, you can most likely, or you can at least strive to achieve shared decision making process in the pains in your chronic pain space. So the other component of this, which I thought was very interesting, little bit more complicated, and I put this as a reference, so what? So we can all go back to it if you're interested, to try to try to tease out the ethical decision making process. And this was published by Anna as well as Dr shatman, a journal of pain research, looking at what the conceptual framework should be. I do think what is important to mention is you have to be able to understand what the role is as a healthcare provider and really understand the role of the patient. And the reason why that's critical is because they're interchangeable. Okay? It's almost like running statistics, right? If you understand the association between variables, you're going to be able to predict what the outcomes are. Now it's the understanding of the variable is so important. And what I like about about this presentation, about this concept, is the moral is you, one has to understand the role that they play as a healthcare provider, but more importantly, understand the role of the patient and and the happy medium is when relationship between both roles are established and communication is very clear, you can achieve a Much better, ethical conversation that can result to hopefully better healthcare outcome. So now we're going to go to the public health component of this conversation. And again, my goal would be to really highlight some of the challenges the framework, again, that we can work with, some of the processes that comes with shared decision making and and really understanding what some of the potential barriers could be with shared decision making. So again, a few papers to highlight the public health aspects of what we do in a chronic pain space. I do like the study. I like to review. I do like the review article written by Dr Steve Cohen recently on Lance, said really highlighting what the burden is for the burden of chronic pain, when the society itself, and it goes back to understanding the pathophysiology, the biopsychosocial model, really understanding how the etiology itself is not just a broken femur. You know, it's the it's the it's the social, psychological, a really good article, highly recommended and not not shocking when you talk about public health and pain, it's very difficult to ignore the opioid crisis, as that was one of the biggest public health concern that we had encountered in this space and still continue to encounter, though it's improved significantly and and then I there's another, another good article I recommend is one by males published in British Journal of anesthesia in 2019 really going through what these factors are that that could be associated with the public health related outcomes in the pain space, and I'll dive into that in the next slide and in subsequent slide. Now, the one thing I wanted to just bring up is, you know, the opioid component, because and in a chronic pain space that the opiate pandemic really shook how we thought about caring for patients and and multiple guidelines have been put in place to mitigate some of this public health concern. And the CDC continues to provide, you know, evidence based guidelines to improve communication. And this is important, because with utilizing shared decision making between you and your patient. It could, you can, one can, can. One can attain even better clinical outcome, because you get to discuss limiting initial prescription when necessary, you get to discuss use of alternative methods, such as the injections, the psychological evaluation or treatment, and then, more importantly, discuss the risk and benefits. So again, you're going into the whole concept of addressing some of the major aspect that has resulted to the pandemic, opioid pandemic in the first place. And I thought it was an important slide to communicate. Yeah. Now, when we think about chronic pain and public health, it's a very complex relationship, and I say complex because we very few studies and and I really wasn't convinced with some of the reports in the literature, partly because it's very hard to really study, but we all know it exists. And the public health component of chronic pain is a complex relationship, but it ties back to understanding the key players or variables that that is, whether directly or indirectly, associated with healthcare outcomes and in a pain space, it's not shocking to see that in in in an age group, gender, ethnic group, cultural background, socio economic background, employment status, and how all of those can has actually impacted access to care or or even ability to go back to work. And the other thing that I that I thought was worth mentioning is lifestyle and behavior and clearly the clinical outcomes some patients coming to the clinic with already more severe pain state versus others who have had access with with less severe pain states, thereby even creating a much more complex relationship. Now is that a public health crisis? Is that a public health issue? I do think a lot a lot of research still needs to be done to truly tie that relationship. What is very clear, though, is that there is a relationship between socio economic status and healthcare outcomes. There is very clear relationship between social economic outcomes and as social determinants of health. And clearly, if that relationship can result to an economic burden, one can hypothesize that you can eventually see the association with with public health and chronic pain and again, don't forget the biopsychosocial model as well. So now, having said that, the question now is, we know that there is a relationship between public health and chronic pain. Now, where does shared decision making come into play? I wanted to really go through this article because it the article did a really good job going through how shared decision making could reduce health inequalities, and it cut across all specialties, not necessarily in the pain space. And these authors, what they did was really looked at, they performed a met a systematic review and meta analysis. They utilized shared decision making models. So the study utilized shared decision making models, it was included. And what was very interesting was they looked at the population of the studies, and if the population had at least 50% that were underserved, that the studies were included in this analysis, and what was found, which I'm not going to go into details, is if you look at the forest plot of the study, was that the forest plot was favorable, favorable towards improving healthcare outcomes Among disadvantaged patients if shared decision making process was implemented. So again, these are very encouraging studies to really highlight that there is signals and there are, there's data out there suggesting that we can, we can truly utilize SDM for improving patient outcome. Now, one of the things that I just wanted to highlight in terms of thinking about what this means is, you know, again, going back to shared decision making process, you introduce a decision, the patient understands it, you present the option, you make recommendation, and then it's always important to ensure that the patient understands it. And the final goal is that a consensus is made where the clinician and patient makes a shared decision based on the clinical evidence, the patient's value and patient patient's preference. There are multiple studies that have discussed how this could be accomplished. Visual aids, AI, all have seemed to be impactful in multiple settings.\n",

      "Title: Talk 1-5\n",
      "Content: I think it's important to remember that there are barriers to shared decision making, time constraint, knowledge gaps, cultural norms, health literacy, that the list goes on and on. But the reason why this is important is because the impact of each of these barriers vary from one setting to another, but it's important to recognize that they exist. Now I go back to this when in doubt slide, and it's really one of the things that I you know, it's hard to accomplish with our busy lives, but, you know, observe it. If you see it, observe it. Ask questions. Is analyze it and communicate it and and the reason why I always go back to this is when you think about the shared decision making space, it's such a young field. It's a very, very young field, especially in chronic pain management. And I do think that there is a lot of work to be done, and there's a potential significant impact that this could have in our space, and with that, I would like to just thank everyone for listening. Patient centered care is why we do what we do. It's truly an honor presenting this talk, and I'm looking forward to taking questions. Thank you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Title: Talk 1-1\n",
      "Content: No, absolutely. Doc Chapman, Dr Coolidge, everybody else who's currently on this call, thanks for the opportunity to really talk about what is extremely important and fundamental in our space, and it's the concept of shared decision making in what we do in chronic pain and management, but really going into the ethical and public health implications that we face pretty much every day, you can argue. And my hope is that, you know, I'll be able to really define what what shared decision making in pain management actually means, going to some of the bioethical principles of shared decision making in a space, and then hopefully analyze the ethical and public health implications of of shared decision making in a chronic pain space. Now the agenda is going to be as it's going to be pretty straightforward. I'll go through the introduction, go through the pain management aspect, the bioethical principles, public health and really my punchline that I usually call when in doubt. So I think there's a fundamental understanding of how history has panned out when it comes to medical decision making. And what's very interesting is, if you look back to the 1900s all the way down to early 1990s you can see that there's there was a huge gap in really understanding the psychology of that patient physician relationship. But what is obvious is that the trend is migrating towards and empowering patients to ensure that they understand why they, why they they receive the care that they did, that they do. Now, having said that is what exactly are we referring to shared as shared decision making. This idea is that the patient and the physician develops shared goals. They develop informed decision and there is patient engagement where the patient is actively involved in the decision making process about their health and the care that they receive. Now this is important, and the reason why this is important is because when shared decision making is implemented, studies have shown that it promotes patient autonomy, satisfaction and the value and preferences of the patients are recognized early to. In the journey of their care. Not shocking. You can see that there are numerous studies, numerous studies that actually talk about the role of shared decision making as it pertains to patient satisfaction, treatment adherence, reducing inequalities, cost reduction and even improving or minimizing what what has been referred to as the decision conflict process that most of us have probably encountered during our clinic visit. So now, the real summary that I you know, one of the summary that I put out here is just so as an audience, you can extrapolate some of the major findings from from the literature. Is the major benefits of shared decision making is there is improved patient and provider satisfaction, which is pretty straightforward, if applied correctly, there is better enhancements to treatment adherence, healthcare outcomes, such as reduction of pain scores, reduction of blood pressure, reduction especially in The primary care space, outcomes that pertains to chronic diseases, it's been documented to see significant improvement in those in those outcomes. Not surprisingly, when there is shared participation, there is reduction in decisional conflict and and multiple studies have reported better efficiency in running that clinical practice increased cost savings, and, like I mentioned previously, reduction of health inequalities, which we're going to get into in the public health aspect. So now we're going to migrate from this broad framework of shared decision making to looking at the evidence, the definition of the pain space, some of the potential decision considerations we should think about as we really go through this framework of shared decision making in a pain space. So not surprisingly, there are multiple studies that have been put out there regarding shared decision making in the pain space. I put this as a reference for for the audience to go back to, should you, if you want to go through some of the high yield studies, clinical trials, as well as review articles out there? But one of the ones that I that I thought was very pertinent to what we do in the chronic pain space goes back to Lisa's article and Lee and Dr Key's article about really how to think about the concept of that patient provider interaction as it relates to shared decision making. Now in the pain space, it's not any different. It's not any different from what you see in the non pain space. When you think about shared decision making, our patient population could be you could classify as pretty complicated because of the multiple etiology that can explain the pain symptoms that they have from the bio psychosocial to the physiologic changes, mechanical changes, physiological changes. But it's the same concept, right? Regardless of the etiology of the chronic pain state. It's the idea that in the in a pain space, shared decision making is sharing information between provider and patients, expressing candid opinions that is geared towards the patient's clinical outcome, and finally, and more importantly, building a consensus towards a treatment decision that will enhance the patient's outcome during your visit. Now I'm going to go through a few process that that could hopefully create a concept of shared decision making and how it can be applied even further in the pain space. The study I just present that I just displayed by Charles really does a good job going through what this encounter looks like. And from this study, which is very cited in the shared decision making space, it comes down to understanding what this definition of shared means. And like I mentioned, participants include the physician and the patient. The information sharing has to be bi directional. It's not just the physician empowering the patient about their diagnosis. It has to be the physician also receiving from the patient what the true. Understand about the diagnosis, so that bi directionality is very important, and the third component is a concept of consensus, that there is an agreement and and the agreement is more because there is understanding of preferred treatment by the patient, and also an understanding of what the conveyed diagnosis is by the physician, and obviously the final component of this is agreeing to a treatment plan that is going going to be executed.\n"

      "Content: Thank you very much for that warm introduction, and it's so nice to meet you all virtually from all across the world, from so many different disciplines. And, you know, perspectives really on on the medical world. I was very excited to be invited to this, since there is the patient perspective, the physician perspective, and it's an interdisciplinary discussion, and ketamine certainly is interdisciplinary as well. So I was tasked with the discussion of the pros and cons, and not to be biased, but I will let you know that I do believe in ketamine, and so that's my first bias before I show you any slide, but I will still be critical of some of the data that does exist, and I will be cognizant of time, and I will make sure to leave time for questions, and I look forward to our vibrant conversation this morning. So with a little bit of introduction, if my slides move, there we go. This is Monte Medical Center. Again, I do wear a few different hats. The most important one is mom and wife. But in addition to that, almost equal to that, is my passion from my vocation. I split my time between working in the perioperative environment, in the regional anesthesia world, covering the Acute Pain Service as well as the other half of my life is spent working with chronic pain patients. And I have a fascination of the acute on chronic pain patient as well, and a love of ketamine. So what are we actually going to be talking about today? I want to be fair, and let me just go up for one moment. I have a special thank you to give to one of my fellows, Dominique Chang, who did help me put together with some of these slides. And I'm very fair about this. I want to give credit where she wears due when she graduates, wherever she will go, she will be a superstar. So today, we're going to talk a little bit about history pharmacology, ketamine in the acute pain world, ketamine in the chronic pain world, and then ketamine for depression and PTSD. Because I think one of the most exciting things about ketamine is it's kind of like salt. You can put it in a lot of different recipes, and it still can be very valuable. And, you know, I think there's been a lot of that other uses. So you know, it's not just one, one peg that goes into a specific hole. It can be a little bit ubiquitous if you know how to use the tool in your hand. So let's talk a little bit about the history of ketamine. What is this medication anyway, and where, how did it even kind of, how do we even start thinking about it? Well, in the 1950s there was a new system that was a new chemical, organic reaction that led to the synthesis of something called PCP. And initially it was planned to be a medical compound, but they kind of noticed that it causes increases in blood pressure and nystagmus, and it did maintain respiration, but then at the same time, there were a lot of severe excitation and for profound psychosis. Hence, when it became a drug of substance abuse, as opposed to an excellent tool for clinical care. But there was something there in the water, and so they found a new compound eventually that had all the positive qualities of PCP, without the major side effects and the severe excitation and the profound psychosis, and that was the one that was eventually called ketamine in 1964 it was used in veterinary medicine first, and it's still used today for veterinary medicine, it was noted to show an excited drunken state in rodents, but kind of a Cate leptoid state in pigeons. And the first human actually received it between 1964 and 1966 and there was a study of over 100 people that was noted and published, and they received these sub anesthetic IV doses, and patients were able to actually report talking about these strange experience of feeling like they were floating and having no arms or legs, and others felt like they were dead. And came back. Well, fast forward to 1970 Kennedy received FDA approval after appropriate clinical trials, and during the Vietnam War, it became actually a widely used anesthetic and wounded victims with hemodynamic instability. And now, if we look at today, it's a modern tool in our toolbox, and has been used in clinical practice for about more than 50 years. In 1985 it was actually. It named an essential medicine by the WHO and actually was thought to be one of the most common anesthetics in the world. You know, recently, due to the opiate crisis, which I'm sure my audience is, is highly aware about, there was a renewed interest in ketamine, both for the acute and chronic pain spheres, and we'll be talking about that as well in terms of more recent guidelines, and even more recently than that, even in the last five years, it was actually proved as a nasal spray for the treatment of new indications, such as resistant depression. It's also been used for other medical disorders such as anxiety and suicidal ideation. So, you know, there's a lot of publicity in this world. This is a sample of an anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation newsletter from June of 2020 it talked about the potential benefits and side effects of ketamine, and also the history of ketamine. It's important to appreciate the fact that you can maintain respiratory drive, minimize cardiovascular depression, attenuate opiate induced hyperalgesia, provided as an adjuvant, acute on chronic pain, choice as an adjuvant, and it actually has anti suicidal and antidepressant properties. On the flip side, you still had to pay attention to some of the negative negatives, such as increased airway secretions and minimizing airway reflux attenuation, it can still be a sympathetic in elevating your heart rate, your blood pressure. Patients who are close to an MI with severe CAD should be used with caution with this medication. And of course, the hallucinations, confusions, vivid dreams and delirium are possible. There are these classic YouTube and Tiktok videos of parents taking pictures of their kids after some kind of surgery on who have received ketamine, where they're a little bit laughing at their kids separate conversation. But you may have seen those kind of videos on the internet, also double vision and blurry vision, and so this was a nice little review piece here, because it was actually discussing some of the benefits to review this established but kind of underappreciated medication, which might be the theme of this talk. That being said, we have to speak with caution, because ketamine gained recent publicity in December of 2023 where it showed that a very famous actor in the social world of the US, Matthew Perry, who had been a character and friends for many years, died as a result of the acute effects of ketamine and subsequent drowning. He was known to have been using this medication for depression and anxiety. And it was noted, though, that outside of the weekly depression dosing, he might have had actually higher levels of ketamine in his system that was found in his post mortem assessment. Sadly, the death was ruled to be an accident. But you know this, this is something where we talk about the discerning eye of ketamine. So let's talk a little bit about the pharmacology of ketamine. Okay, what is this drug that's so powerful it does so many things? Well, there's a few antimers of it. It has RNs. Thank you. Organic Chemistry. The s anti antemer is actually considered about three to four times more potent than its cousin, and has a greater affinity for the PCP binding receptor. The S version has a shorter duration of action and possesses greater neuro protective and analgesic properties than its R component, which might actually potentially make it a more ideal analgesic. But preclinical and clinical analgesic studies comparing the two have thus kind of yielded conflicting data so far in terms of abuse, potential studies comparing the two antimers have also produced mixed results. But for depression, two animal studies did demonstrate more sustained anti depression effects for the R antiandre, but there's no really clinical studies to guide this. Just know that there are two directions that ketamine can take.\n",

      "Content: Aniations, similar to multiple guidelines for epidural injections, conservative series of infusions should not be administered by root but rather tailored to the patient response. So patients should not be treated all the same, not one size fits all, but should be, you know, really titrated to the person, and considering the long term risks of ketamine, limiting to no more than six to 12 treatments per year is reasonable, so I think deviations can be made as well many times. We didn't do it that way necessarily, but that's grade C evidence and also still under discussion. Okay, so another thing that kind of gets exciting is all of these different receptors. So both in acute pain and chronic pain, there are lots of prevalence of rates of surgery and acute pain and post traumatic pain. And so I think there's a lot of room for further studies in this area. I want to make sure we have enough time for questions. This is a pain faculty talking about the use of non cancer pain outside of the US, and so again, it's being studied across the world. Reminder that there are many different sample infusion rates, and this is another one from halfway across the world. This is from Dr Cohen, who is not too far from us and recently moved institutions talking about his sample rates. And then I briefly want to touch on depression and make sure we have enough time for questions. I promised myself and promised at my my colleagues, that I would be on time and I will be so. I think this is an exciting subtopic, just to whet your appetite, remember that anybody who has depression, 1/3 of patients with chronic pain have concurrent psychiatric comorbidities such as depression, and so you wonder how much of these pathways overlap each other. There are clinical trials that have talked about ketamine for depression, for prevention of PTSD, the primary effects were thought to be part of the NMDA receptor, but actually may be part of these other glutamate pathways. May be affecting the gabapentinoid pathways, and there's a lot of beginnings of discussions on this topic. And if you're interested, I highly recommend there's a DR Huberman who is from Stanford in California, and he does these wonderful podcast type YouTube videos discussing these topics. He's an excellent speaker. And if you have a fascination in this specific subtype area, I highly recommend him. I don't know him, but I think his videos are great. So you know, what's interesting about ketamine for depression is, again, we're the electricians of the human body. We're playing with the NMDA receptor. We're trying to change that glutamate surge there, mother, there are a number of things that are modulated in the brain, and then there's an increase of gabapentin, GABA B levels. And so isn't it exciting that there can be this cascade of effects that have been noted to have serial surges and might actually be able to affect this state as well for post operative depression, it's been controversial, to be fair, the studies are still not 100% I clearly drink the Kool Aid. But please, let me be fair. In my conversation in 2023 there was a meta analysis of 15 studies that discussed perioperative ketamine, reducing post operative depression, increased risks, such as nausea, vomiting, hallucinations. In a double randomized blind trial, ketamine was given to 210, patients undergoing C section with spinal anesthesia, and the ketamine did not reduce their depression at one, two or four weeks post operatively. And you know, post postpartum depression is something that exists in 2021 ketamine was given to neurosurgery patients undergoing intracranial tumor resection, and this trial did show that ketamine could reveal moderate to severe depression in neurosurgical patients. So you know, we're kind of poking in the waters in this area, but I think there's a lot of room to keep digging. So these are a few references, and then, most importantly, this is my family. And so I leave you with the thoughts of, may you always have a purpose to do better as a person and as a professional, for your vocation, your ethics and your life choices, and this is the reason I do what I do. And with that, thank you very much. I'm on time, gentlemen and ladies, I have five minutes left for question. I'm going to stop sharing my slides.\n",

      "Title: Talk 4-5\n",
      "Content: Okay? And I think another thing that's very nice is that this is a global phenomenon, so this is just a sample of a five year study current, currently going on outside of the US. So I think it's important to recognize that we are thinking about this, these kind of studies all over the world. Okay, we talked a little bit about acute pain. We talked a little bit about history of ketamine. Now let's briefly talk about chronic pain. So chronic pain, which is my love. There's also consensus guidelines on chronic pain and ketamine. Again, same three societies. They also put out discussions many of the same authors, as you'll note here, since there are other people who wear these multiple hats of acute to chronic pain, and you know, ketamine IV infusions have been have been in existence for some time. When we think about what we know for sure, I mentioned being part of a CRPS center. So that is one of those areas where there is definite, moderate certainty, of evidence for ketamine infusions, and it's been shown to provide pain relief for up to 12 weeks. We can see here. Here's a sample of somebody with a CRPS syndrome of the foot. And I myself have been able to have the luxury of witnessing these patients from before and after their infusions, and then visiting us in the hospital afterwards. And you know, once you see it, you believe it. So I drink the Kool Aid for chronic pain patients for many other reasons, neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia, cancer pain, ischemic pain, migraine pain, low back pain. Unfortunately, there's still weak or no evidence really to support those uses. But I'm, I'm a personal believer. I just can't present to you that data today based on the 2018 guidelines. Okay, so what's the summary? CRPS is great, and everything else is dot, dot, dot. Well, excluding CRPS, there's no real evidence to support ketamine for intermediate or long term pain relief in those situations, there is low, low certainty evidence supporting oral ketamine as a follow up therapy after ketamine infusions. And there's also oral ketamine can be associated with high abuse potential and should be prescribed cautiously, right? So when we use it with the intranasal ketamine for breakthrough pain, it's it has some moderate evidence there, but it can be used for short term actin. So what do we really do with all of this? It's a little bit confusing, right? So we know it kind of works in the short term. We know it works for CRPS, but everything else, the waters are a little bit mucky at this point in time, even though Dr bersenko is telling you it's great, there are certain pain populations at the same time where ketamine should be considered for infusion therapy, well, for spinal cord injury, there is weak evidence supporting infusion rates ranging from 17 minutes to five hours for seven days, for short term improvements of pain, for CRPS, we talked about it that one, we feel like we can put a grade B checkmark recommendation for mixed neuropathic pain syndromes, like all the ones I mentioned right now, weak or no evidence, at least for immediate improvements of pain, grade D, unfortunately. So excluding CRPS, there's no real evidence supporting all these chronic pain and intermediate, long term improvements of pain. What are we going to do with that? Well, let's also talk about the contrary indications to continue this Debbie downward movement. Well, the contraindications are similar for acute pain and serial ketamine infusion should not be taken in patients who have active a substance abuse problem, and should be used along with universal cautions with regards to abuse, that's grade C evidence. Okay, so, and we've seen people who unfortunately have suffered the sequelae of ketamine. Okay, the other part of ketamine is it's really expensive, well, so this is from 2022 and this is a discussion from the Azra pain societies, and they talk about how expensive it is, so there's no FDA approved real indication for these infusions as a treatment modality, and the data has shown growing evidence that, you know, we don't really know exactly what we're doing here, so maybe we shouldn't pay for it. So I can tell you where I was, in one of my prior institutions, there were a lot of people there who had money, and so because of that, the numbers didn't quite matter so much, and they were able to have these seven day stays and to have these high dose treatments, and that wasn't really an issue. Many of them were lucky to have amazing results. That being said, this is not somebody, this is not a treatment that has equity, because insurance companies are not equal and this, this is not something where all patients can have access to this treatment. And I think that that's one of the things that also limits its exploration at this stage of the game. So is there any evidence for supporting. In therapeutic dose cutoff thresholds, infusion rates or higher doses. Maybe, if we give them a lot more, you know, maybe, maybe that'll make it better. Well, there's is moderate evidence to support higher dosage of ketamine over longer periods of time and more frequent in administration for chronic pain. So great. So if we can just get them the drug, give them more of it and do it more frequently, maybe we're gonna have better data there. There's similar strategies used for opiates and other analgesics with significant adverse effects, though, so it's reasonable to start with a single outpatient infusion and then kind of reassessing treatment. And so that's a great see evidence of great we can kind of titrate it up, but if we don't have access to the drug, and if it doesn't help everyone, there's, there's, there's some, there's some holes in this, in this road that we're trying to travel upon. So is there any role for oral ketamine? Okay, so IV infusions are kind of meh. We're not perfect here. What about oral or other NMDA receptor antagonisms as a follow up for treatment in rule of in lieu of repeat infusions? Well, there's low level support of oral ketamine and other NMDA receptor antagonism as a follow up therapy. There's moderate evidence to talk about intranasal and then also the oral ketamine still has significant abuse potential and street value. So you know, do we really want to be adding this to the waters of what exists in the in the common world, used with caution, and then also considering the cost and resources, it's kind of complicated, so at least we might want to consider these intranasal, oral and other treatments in lieu of serious treatment, at least that one is at least Grade B evidence, because the other stuff is so expensive and complicated to organize that maybe we can at least look at those other routes and begin to explore that more. So I'm encouraging this conversation, even outside of today's Grand Rounds. Okay, so let's just say that we have the ketamine Great. What tests should be ordered prior to an infusion of ketamine? Well, there's insufferative evidence about this as well. So pre infusion testing, we're not really sure what we need to do for the healthy person who's just starting this out, individuals at higher risk of cardiovascular events might might consider, you know, baseline ECG testing, you know, to exclude individuals with uncontrolled ischemic disease that we didn't know about and invasion in patients with baseline liver dysfunction who are alcoholics or people with chronic hepatitis or who are expected to receive very high doses of ketamine at frequent intervals, you know, basic and post infusion liver function tests should be considered, and that's grade C evidence all of this, as I mentioned in my in my clinical practice, we did do those kind of testing, but it's still grade C evidence. What training is prudent for patients who, for personnel, excuse me, who administer boluses and infusions and oversee titrations. Well, you know, ketamine doses, again, they vary, and so it's important to understand and see who these patients are and have appropriate follow up. Patients who are older might have different thresholds, so they might need different monitoring. Higher cutoffs with sub anesthetic doses may also be utilized, and so again, need to be recognized. But the basics of monitoring include hemodynamic and respiratory parameters, and they remain irrespective of the route of administration or dosing. We have to make sure these patients are okay, and of course, with that, we have to make sure there's availability of personnel and equipment for resuscitation at all times, and that is Grade C evidence. So no matter what happens, Grade A evidence is be safe and be prudent. What about what about preemptive medications for administration as rescue drugs. There's limited direct evidence support of the preemptive use of benzodiazepines, and no evidence to support antidepressant, antihistamine and anticholinergic pre medications. This is Grade C evidence. I do think, in my clinical practice, what we've always done is started the ketamine, and then, if needed, started the benzodiazepine, but there are times when they're started simultaneously, especially if they are patients that have had multiple rounds of this. There might be an expected reaction and expected dose dosing of this, and did recipe, but the recommendation preemptively is still grade C. So what constitutes a positive treatment response? Well, if we look at the refractory nature of this disease, a positive outcome was actually considered to be 30% greater or greater relief in conjunction with patient satisfaction. And as we can appreciate, you know, patient satisfaction is very hard in the chronic pain patient. On the flip side, 30% could be like a placebo effect. So what really is that? But you know, this is what the definition is discussed at in terms of duration of benefit, greater than 30 weeks as a single outpatient infusion, and greater than six weeks following an inpatient or series of infusions are considered reasonable delay.\n"

      "Content: Now, let me, I'll let you put up your slides, Dr Clow, and I'm gonna, just for my sake, pull up the introduction here as Dr Clow is pulling up his slides. Dr Daniel Clow is a professor of anesthesiology, medicine, rheumatology and Psychiatry at the University of Michigan. He began his academic career at Georgetown University after attending undergraduate and medical school at the University of Michigan. He was a faculty member at Georgetown from 1992 2002 serving as chief of division of rheumatology and Vice Chair of Medicine. Well at Georgetown, he founded the chronic pain and fatigue Research Center, and in 2002 was recruited to bring this group to the University of Michigan, where the group has become one of the most successful pain research groups in the world. He's also served as the first PI of the University of Michigan Clinical and Translational Sciences Award, as well as the first Associate Dean for clinical and translational research, and founded the Institute that houses the University of Michigan, CTSA and the Michigan Institute for Clinical and Health Research. He needs over 450 peer reviewed publications, over 100 million in federal funding, and CPF RC was recently awarded the NIH heal interdisciplinary team science award. He's been a very active mentor for multiple scientists and clinicians, serving as the primary mentor of 35 NIH K awards, nearly all of whom have gone to obtain RC. Or his funding, or the equivalent. It's really a delight to have him here. I followed his work for a number of years, dating us. He had been speaking and speak spoken with us at the request of a Tim the support group at the ether dome, many years ago. And we're delighted to have him back, and we'll be interested in continuing the collaboration.\n",

He's the science communicator with the McGill office for science and society dedicated to separating sense from nonsense on his scientific stage. He has a master's degree in molecular biology, and he brings his experience in cancer research, human genetics, rehab research and forensic biology to the work he does for the public. He was a creator, writer and a host of the YouTube show cracked science, which used the late night deep dive format to debunk pseudoscience and denounce bad science. With cardiologist Dr Christopher levos, he co host the award winning medical podcast the body of evidence, which aims to contextualize findings in the realm of health research and answer the public's most pressing questions about the biomedical sciences, while also being rather funny and entertaining, he talks about science every Friday on CTV Montreal news, and is regularly interviewed in both English and French languages. As we all know, the area of pain has been challenged, and this is an area where we need much greater focus on issues of science, as opposed to some of the challenges that occur in our field. So Jonathan, thank you again for doing this. Turn it over to you, and we'll welcome questions at the end.\n",
